"5","Trip.com - a fantastic resourceTrip.com has been a fantastic resource for my hotel bookings. And of the 3 places I booked, 2 lived up to the representation as shown, one slightly not. Overall an excellent app and I’d say pay attention to whether a resort is given a 3 star, 4 star rating etc. 4 star above lives up to representations. 3 star don’t. Happy travels.

"7","Payment Something strange, upon departure, the hotel presented me with room bill for payment. I showed them the documents of my room prepaid in advance. The staff told me they haven't received any payment yet. But I refused to make any payments, insisting that my room was already prepaid.They then allowed me to check out.Date of experience: 09 March 2024","4"
"8","Great dealGreat deal, booked a very last minute flight (travelling the next day) from Thailand to London via China. Using 2 different airlines, Sichuan airlines & Air China. Got a great price and E tickets for the 2 airlines sent by email. Checking in was easy and I didn’t have to collect my baggage and recheck in as the airline Sichuan airlines took care of that for me. What I will say is Do Not buy any liquids ie Alcohol in Thailand as once you go through passport control again in Chengu airport they take the liquids off of you even if sealed in a duty free bag, any liquids even under 100ml. I have now downloaded the app and will definitely be using Trip.com again and will also recommend it to my daughter who is going travelling next month and her friends. Plus you collect coins with every purchase to give you money off your next booking. Especially when travelling, every little helps! 😊 Date of experience: 08 March 2024","5"

"11","Baggage Allowance IssueWe booked a 4 sector ticket. The first leg SGN to BNK with Vietnam Airlines that already included a 20kg allowance. We booked allowances for the other 3 sectors as the flights with Air Asia. Our baggage allowance was charged to the first sector by mistake leaving sector 2 with no allowance meaning we will have to pay again at check in. Trip.com does not assist in any dealings with baggage. Date of experience: 11 March 2024","2"

"19","Avoid booking with trip.com at all costsAvoid booking with trip.com at all costs. Despite contacting them well in advance, I faced a brick wall when attempting to cancel my trip. Even though I had only booked the trip two weeks prior, they adamantly refused any form of reimbursement or voucher. When I pleaded for a change in flight dates, they callously shut me down yet again. Their utter disregard for customer satisfaction is appalling. They've pocketed over £200 of my hard-earned money with no remorse or assistance offered. As a student on the exchange without the means to recover from such a loss, I am at a loss of what to do especially when I was pretty much told tough luck not our problem. Spare yourself the headache and avoid this company because they don't care about customers Date of experience: 26 February 2024","1"

"62","emergency contact not belong to any of my family or myselfLike: Online customer services not only with robot talk but human, that's better.Dislike: options as Additional baggage allowance shown in adds-on however paid then was notified it's not allowed and not successfully purchased, that's very disappointing as the key reason to choose that air ticket is because of adding on baggage allowance existing and allow to pay.  It caused inconvenience and end up I paying more for that flight cuz Trip.com told me to purchase on airline website (website is not working well on payment)and not just I paid about 60dollar on international calling, it's I spent 45mins on phone. Plus the airline website shown a emergency contact mobile number n email not even belong to myself or my family members .I asked the airline,he said it left by trip.com, the travel agency. when I checked with online customer services,I was told it's from airline and I need to modify it with airline myself..but I m like a ping-pong ball. Airline says it's travel agency I purchased air tickets from, I need to solve out myself with trip.com. that's very frustrating and confused. Which my Booking info on airline website shld not leave any contacts I don't know. Date of experience: 29 February 2024","2"

"83","Would Never Use This Company EVER againI’m surprised, shocked, and horrified to say the least. I did not expect such a sour experience with this company. I did my research, looked at the reviews and thought that this was a booking agency I could trust. Their prices seemed too good to be true but naively, trustingly, I bought a $700 return ticket through them. Upon issues with check in, the company was an absolute sheeeeet show of help (put nicely) and then refused a refund, to change my flight, or offer any real advice. The flight was purchased on behalf of my partner who needed to renew a visa asap so rebooking a flight within a 24 hour period (AND NO LATER) was non-negotiable for me. I was offered 5,000 fly points as some sort of consolation, amounting to $50. Kind of pathetic when I spent $700 and invested my faith, but hey, I decided I would use this company once more as I’m a believer in second chances and did feel as if they were trying to help.Lo and behold I spent multiple hours trying to purchase a new ticket with my flight points, only to find no option to apply them. I tried on my phone. On my laptop. I installed the app. I verified my account multiple times. I rang customer service FIVE TIMES. I spent the rest of my day in a confused rage trying to use a bugged, glitched website, being talked to by a different representative. Being offered patronising comments and no solution. This company has enough money to have a fully functioning server and website, yet they do not? So where do the funds for their business venture go?To ‘gift’ me flight points that cannot be used… ooooof what an absolute joke.The most I got was ‘our tech team will review this within 72 hours’ But by 72 hours my desired flight would have long gone and my partner would have gone into overstaying, breaching the terms of his visa.‘We can offer you more flight points’ your server is having an issue where I’m not able to pay via credit card, PayPal or anything other than debit card- LET ALONE select my flight points. That’s like offering me an expired coupon. It’s COMPLETELY useless. And you best believe I sent screenshots from laptop and phone which were just ignored. Honestly they treated me like I didn’t know how to use the internet, despite being a frequent traveller and well versed in technology, this company took no responsibility. Despite being honest. Patient. And even trusting of the customer service team.. I have come out of this experience feeling bitter, belittled and would caution anyone wanting a safe, comfortable travel to use ANY of the other HUNDREDS of companies available. This one is not worth the risk unfortunately and 99% sure they buy off their reviews instead of investing into a worthwhile business.Date of experience: 27 February 2024","1"

"129","Mis-sold flight due to baggage…Mis-sold flight due to baggage allowanceFolks, I booked a flight from LHR to ATQ (Heathrow to Amritsar) with the airline Vistara.Whilst booking online, and throughout the whole booking process on trip.com, the luggage allowance was highlighted as 2 x 23kg for check-in baggage. I took screen shots and also a video of the process.With the peace of mind that the luggage was indeed 2 x 23kg I went ahead with the booking.I was then issued to e-tickets, one for the return leg LHR to DEL which stated 2 x 23kg allowance and then another e-ticket for the domestic flights from Delhi to Amritsar which showed 1 x 15kg allowance.Please note that my booking was from LHR to ATQ as a complete booking with a stop-over in Delhi. I was expecting one e-ticket.Now, due to having received two e-tickets the whole journey is now subject to the 1 x 15kg allowance unless I pay the extra to allow the 2 x 24kg allowance.Vistara state that if you are issued a single e-ticket then the luggage allowance for the whole journey applies, that's 2 x 23kg from LHR to ATQ. But, if you have two e-tickets then you are subject to the baggage allowances stated on each ticket.This is the response from trip after 11 days of emails:We have received a response from our IT department regarding your feedback on baggage display. It has been acknowledged that the baggage allowance for the New Delhi-Amritsar flight shows one piece(s), while the return flight from Amritsar to New Delhi shows 15kg during your booking. Therefore, we are unable to take responsibility for any additional expenses incurred for baggage allowance purchases. Thank you for your understanding in this matter.There is no evidence provided despite me providing a screen recording of the booking process.  Even today I can make the same booking without being told of the reduced luggage allowance.Date of experience: 14 December 2023","1"

"173","Incompetent, disinterested, disorganized: save your money and book with someone else!Two refunds from this company have gone missing. Trying to get more details about these refunds (transaction numbers, refund mode, payment processor, etc.) has been like pulling teeth. Each time, they repeat the same spiel over and over, and tell you to go to the bank with the same info they're not giving you. You're always attended to by someone with a different name, too, so you're totally guaranteed of reasonable follow-ups to your case.To make matters worse, despite multiple instructions to correspond with the owner of the account only, they keep harassing the passenger named on the booking, who has had no part in the transaction and is also now subjected to this pathetic show of ""customer service,"" primarily through the farce of multiple emails sent to their account with more or less the same message each time.UPDATE: Following this review, they are now harassing me on my mobile phone at 8:30 in the evening, despite explicit instructions not to contact me unless they've made substantive progress on my case, and by email to a designated account only. I'm clearly dealing with a steaming sewer of ineptitude and complete disregard over here.FURTHER UPDATE: It turns out that Trip.com has opened multiple cases for my problem, resulting in further harassment of the passenger and evidently, crossed wires. ""Rachel"" clearly didn't get the memo that Trip.com's Customer Success Team has dealt with, and resolved my case, earlier this week (following much gaslighting and unreasonable requests though, I regret to add).Again, the lack of competence and basic communication shown here isn't exactly confidence boosting. And no amount of claims that I ""failed"" to communicate with you on this matter will convince me to either remove or modify my rating at this point, because this has been a truly, truly awful experience from beginning to end.Date of experience: 15 February 2024","1"

"226","Predatory practices to pay more to trip.comI recently faced a highly unsatisfactory situation with Trip.com that I feel compelled to share. My journey from Shanghai to Karachi, booked for 4007 CNY, was unexpectedly disrupted when the airline decided to move the second leg of my flight from February 8th to February 13th without my consent. While a partial refund of 1845 CNY was initiated, this gesture hardly made up for the inconvenience and additional costs I was subjected to.Seeking to maintain my original travel schedule, I found myself facing the prospect of shelling out an extra 1013 CNY due to the increased prices of alternative flights. This situation not only added financial strain but also significant stress to my travel planning.What disappoints me most is Trip.com’s handling of the situation. The lack of proactive communication and adequate resolution has seriously undermined my trust in their service. I expected a seamless experience, was left to navigate this disruption largely on my own.This experience has highlighted a concerning lack of customer support and flexibility in addressing issues that arise, particularly those not of the customer’s making. It’s disheartening to see such a reputed company fail to provide the necessary support and compensation to their customers in times of need.I urge potential customers to consider this review carefully before booking with Trip.com. It’s crucial to choose a service that not only offers competitive prices but also backs it up with exceptional customer care, especially when unforeseen changes occur.Date of experience: 06 February 2024","1"

In addition, they charged almost double of what the airline would normally charge and then later shared that the additional $27 was a service fee. It has been difficult getting help as they won’t refund it but the baggage doesn’t show up when I go to the airline check in. Don’t pay for baggage through Trip as it has been a nightmare. Just wait and purchase directly through the airline.Date of experience: 29 January 2024","2"

"360","Disappointed with assistance provided by phoneI booked air tickets through Trip.com after finding out from the website that it is quite straightforward to update my daughter’s passport number and expiry date subsequently after she had obtained her new passport i.e., I need to just call Trip.com to do that. However, when I called Trip.com on 28 Dec, I was instead told to call an overseas number by the staff who attended to me. I was shocked as this would mean I need to incur overseas call charges. I asked to escalate this to the staff’s supervisor. At the same time, I did try calling the number given numerous times but I was either put on hold indefinitely or the calls were not successfully connected. While waiting for an update from the supervisor, I also tried to email to a few accounts I found on Air China’s website in the hope that one of them would hopefully be able to provide the assistance I need. Fortunately, Saya called in the afternoon to inform me that she had managed to contact Air China and notified them to update my daughter’s passport details directly.I appreciate Saya’s assistance. At the same time, I would think twice about booking air tickets from Trip.com in the future.Date of experience: 28 December 2023","2"

They were three times more expensive than the original tickets I had purchased through Trip.com. Our trip took a great turn when Violet emailed me. She said she looked into my case and agreed to refund me the money I spent on the extra flights. She also offered me extra Tripcoins for the trouble we went through.

There was no compensation. Almost 4000 usd tickets were charged.Their customer service team is extremely deceptive. They cheated on the Shanghai municipal bureau of tourism by claiming they are based in Singapore and therefore enjoys some kind of legal immunity.

"457","Great ExperienceFirst off, the prices on Trip.com are really quite good and seem to beat almost everyone fairly consistently. I travel a lot and Trip.com is definitely saving me some money. Their rewards program seems half decent as well, on top of the other rewards you get from the airlines themselves when you book.I did have a delayed flight with a trip I booked with Trip.com due to no fault of their own, but do to mechanical issues with an American Airlines flight. I had booked business class but ended up in economy class on the next available flight and was refunded money. It did take a little bit to get everything sorted, but it wasn’t difficult and the people at Trip.com did genuinely help and the money is back in my account for the fare difference between business class and economy class. I will also say American Airlines was helpful as well all along the way. I have read some reviews that say Trip.com takes months to provide refunded money, but that wasn’t the situation in my case at all. I also cancelled another booking I made (which was sold as a cancellable itinerary) and the money was refunded in minutes and the process was automatic from the website. I don’t really see any problem with Trip.com. Their support is good (I was able to reach them in less than 2 minutes online) and their policies are really quite fair. The prices are better than most places. I think for people who know how to travel well, and what they want and the pitfalls that sometimes come with air travel, Trip.com is a really good option. I would say if you can book directly with the airline for a similar price then go with the airline. For me, the airline sells a business class product for about $2200 and Trip.com is selling it to me for $1000 and change. Same flight.Date of experience: 11 December 2023","5"

They did nor contact us about the denied change until after the original flight time had already passed and denied us refund for the tickets. Secondly, we needed a name change for a future ticket and they took forever to get the information to us that they cannot do that and to call them. I called them and they said I still had to wait for it. I dont trust this company and their response time is lacking. Seems they just want to make you wait until it's to late to provide a refund.

I then asked for a vegetarian option and was also told that it wasn’t an option. I have been using this particular airline for years and I know that both options are available. My first flight which is a 12 hours flight - I wasn’t able to eat because the crew members said that the vegetarian options had to be requested (which I am aware of but the Trip app customer service refused to do their job). I had to call the actual airline to ask for my meal option and the lady kindly added a “Muslim meal” under my booking for my next flight back. Customer service on the Trip app don’t know what they are doing and are giving the wrong information. I will NOT be booking through the app again.

I once booked a hotel only for the indoor swimming pool and sauna facilities, however, after checking in, we were told the facilities had been under maintenance for a few months and we had no choice to refund or change our booking (If trip.com could get regular updates of the facilities, and if this was known to us, we wouldn’t book this hotel).Date of experience: 05 December 2023","4"

"743","Terrible experienceI do not recommend this App or website despite the deals. Getting in contact with customer support is nearly impossible and they are more work rather than helpful. I booked my flight in February. The trip was for November. During that time I got divorced. When I submitted the request for my name to be changed on the ticket, the first time around they said the airlines declined the request and I would need to buy a new ticket. The 2nd time I contacted them about it they said they would need to make a new booking and fees would apply. I contacted the airlines directly and they never received the request and they showed me where it says in their policies that a legal name change is my right and I should not be charged anything or need a new ticket. Trip.com refused to acknowledge this and sent me on a wild goose chase for a month before my flight. At the airport all I had to do was provide my old passport and other legal documents and there were no problems going to my destination and coming back. Trip.com was just trying to get more money out of me. Shameful. Will never use again and will discourage others from using it.Date of experience: 01 October 2023","1"

Second Incident: Due to flight changes and cancellation, I have seeked for a reimbursement for my hotel bookings. Trip.com yet again promised to reply me within the next 24 hours which they committed to as well. As expected, there were no replies or updates for more than 48 hours and I have to seek for an update by writing in again.Update: As expected, the customer support team replied that they are unable to do anything for my case and asked me to contact the airline directly. They do not even have the initiative to help us connect with a person from the airline to streamline the process for a customer. Totally unreliable!Date of experience: 10 November 2023","1"

Could I please get some help regarding these refunds and flight replacements?

"890","Reliable, trustworthy and professional agentMy the flight was canceled just few days before the departure and she had left the country in a place she couldn’t possibly to do anything without internet.  She then asked me to deal all the change and rebook. I had great difficulty to find new ticket. And we supposed  to Join the tour.  Then Cobain took over the case, in a very calm and efficient manner, he did everything for me and spent so many phone calls to consult me to get the best connection and also insured my friend had an overnight hotel for a longer transition.  I was so relieved when the matter resolved. Imagine if we couldn’t arrive on time for the tour. The way he deal the situation impressed me that gave me confidence to use Trip.com again in the future. Nowadays not many platforms are so responsive. Thanks again Cobain.Sincerely Heather DonnellyDate of experience: 18 September 2023","5"

"905","An 'Old' hotelThe charge of the hotel is reasonable. The hotel upgraded me to a suite. It is located near the old town of Macao and I could access to many eating places, casinos, tourist interested places and shopping areas. The reason I called it an old hotel is: I like the hotel provided a washing and drying machine. But the drying function of the machine was not functioning well and it had no way to tell until I found out that my clothes were still wet.Date of experience: 27 September 2023","4"

"912","Avoid at all costs - if I could rate 0 stars I wouldFirst time booking through trip.com and what an absolute mistake it was. I took out tickets as a surprise gift for my mum, unfortunately she fell really ill and has been hospitalised and now unable to fly, due to looking after my mum in hospital I’m also unable to fly. I contacted trip.com to see if I could push the flight back they said that was not possible and the adviser said he could raise a case for a full refund due to the unfortunate circumstance, he told me to send an email and provide proof of hospitalisation. 11 minutes later I recieved an email to say the best they can do is a £20 refund which is 1/8 of the price of the ticket. This was prior to them sending me an email saying they expedited my case (email they sent 2 hours later than the initial email)  and prior to me sending and email explaining the situation and an attachment of proof (they didn’t respond to my email). I called them again to chase up the response to be told they cancelled my case to which the guy then had to escalate again and said that he understands the frustration I am feeling and the stress in my voice. Not long after I get an email from a superior manager that my case has been escalated to and this time I’m told that the best they can do is offer me £24 (£4 more than the original best I can do) which I find very insulting. The way this company has handled this situation is disgraceful no empathy shown, they have the choice to use discretion in cases like this especially when I’m willing to provide evidence of my mum being in hospital (which I don’t think anyone should have to prove!) The way this company has dealt with this just shows they care more about making money than their customers, my first experience and my last !Date of experience: 30 October 2023","1"

"941","AVOID AT ALL COSTS!The incident in question pertains to a customer who had made a reservation through Trip.com in good faith, for return flights LDN to Seville with Vueling Airlines. Regrettably, Trip.com provided Vueling Airlines with their corporate details rather than the customer's information. This oversight led to the customer being abandoned for three days, stranded without the resources to secure alternative arrangements, including accommodation and essential services. Airline could not assist due to GDP & the incorrect information Trip had given them. Trip.com blames the airline(deflecting blame for their error) and left us abandoned.  We can not independently claim from Veuling as their contract is with Trip.com and Trip.com have been refusing for 10 weeks to assist, referring us back to a website every time.The lack of immediate resolution to this grave error, along with Trip.com's unwillingness to address the financial losses incurred by the customer, is a matter of great concern. This situation not only represents a clear breach of trust but also raises questions about the company's accountability and ethical standards. Their customer service is appalling, repeated scripted responses, providing irrelevant information, deflecting blame, passes the buck and vague repetitive responses. Please avoid at all costs they over charge and do not provide the service you pay for and in the event of your flight or hotel being cancelled be rest assured you are on your own!.  My personal experience is minus 100 stars! They need to retrain their staff and change their systems to an ethical standard.  Effective customer service should aim to actively listen to customers, address their concerns, and provide timely and relevant solutions or information to create a positive and satisfying interaction.  This sadly does not happen @Trip.comDate of experience: 28 August 2023","1"

Breakfast area was very nice. Breakfast very good with lots of choice in fruits, cereals, juices etc. with nicely cooked hot breakfast    Reception disappointing. Very business like only asking name of booking. No pleasantries at all. Had to ask for times of breakfast and where it was served. Lift was broken, no offer of help, although alternative longer route without stairs was given.   For us breakfast times disappointing. There for restful night and easy morning. Breakfast finished at 9.30 so we felt we needed to be there by 9.00 and had hoped for ""lazier"" morning. 10.00 would have been good although I realise other factors will have to be considered by hotel.

"948","Thank you Sophia for my last experience…Thank you Sophia for my last experience with Trip. I'd ordered a plane ticket via trip and the flight was cancelled. I was automatically booked on an other flight leaving at the same time but with a connection that made me arrive 4hours later. I was going to Copenhagen for an important conference and couldn't arrive later than what I had planed. I then immediately phoned the France trip company.  They explained they could do nothing for me. I then left a rude comment explaining my experience and why I wasn't happy. I then finally was contacted by Sophia from Customer Success. She was very nice and polite. She tried helping me as best as she could, but unfortunately no solutions were found before the flight.Comes the day of my flight. I still had no solution to arrive in Copenhagen on the time. I was left with no other choice than to buy an 192$ ticket for the early flight. After that I asked Sophia if I could get some sort of compensation and she explained very politely that no compensations could be made. Three weeks later, I get a lovely email form Sophia explaining that she got the results from the airline company and I got a full refund for my ticket (192$). I was so delighted. I really want to thank Sophia that really tried the best she could to help me and that never let go of the case, even three weeks after departure. She always stayed polite, nice and very professional. It is only thanks to her professionalism, perseverance, had work and engagement that I was able to get total refund.

"956","Worst voucher / restitution service I've ever experienced…Worst voucher / restitution service ever experiencedAfter canceling a previous flight I got information on receiving a voucher from the specific airline. After digging I couldn't find said voucher so I called the airline. They said it was the responsibility of the agent, so trip.com in this case. I contacted them and after half an hour of back and forth they finally understood the task - to get my voucher. However, it's not as straightforward as that. To use my voucher, I can only book through their booking service by email. The process I had to go through to get them to understand exactly what I wanted was painful. Finally they understood and processed the booking. This first booking was wrong, so had to be altered. The second booking was okay, but then they send the payment link - which is only active for 2 hours(!!!!?) - at 2 AM at night. By this process taking ages my flight cost has increased a couple hundred dollars already, leaving me with nearly no added value of my voucher anymore. At the moment of writing and 2 weeks into this process I still have yet to get my flight ticked secured, using my voucher.

Search using them and find the airline and flight you want. Then call the airline direct and purchase from them. They are now responsible for delays, cancelations, etc.  The only reason I used trip.com is because I am in Philippines and could not make local call. So I just loaded app. Bad choice. I made an error on time booking flight then immediately called trip.com. Trip.com said to call Cebu Airlines. Upon doing so Cebu airlines said that I had to call trip.com to change. Trip.com again said they cannot change and Cebu airlines would have to do it. I finally asked them what the fee is to change and it was double the price of my ticket. So I did what I should have done in first place and went to Philippine Airline and just bought a new ticket with correct time so I could catch next flight from Manila to Bangkok. Use the Airline do not trust any of these scammer agencies.Date of experience: 25 October 2023","1"

"977","Appalling serviceAppalling service! We have stayed at this hotel several times pre-covid. Their product and service have been good when the hotel was first opened but this time, their level service has declined so much, it made our stay very frustrating and disappointing - Worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in!We were booked for a triple-sharing (3 adults) room for 5 nights. Noticing that there were only 2 sets of towels in the room on Day 1, we asked the housekeeping staff that we met on the guest floor to add an additional set. She initially refused to add an extra set of towels saying that that is how all rooms are supposed to be set up, but eventually reluctantly gave us an extra bath towel.Day 2 evening: We returned to find our room not made up (duvet was still untidy and cups unwashed) and only 2 sets of fresh towels. The phone was faulty and could not be connected to operator (by dialing 0) or any other services. When I went down to feedback, the Front Desk staff said that their system showed only 2 persons staying (despite taking all 3 passports for registration upon check-in). She said Trip.com did not communicate the triple occupancy (with extra person charges paid) to the hotel. She arranged for an extra set of toiletries to be sent up. When I asked her to ensure we do not face this same problem again for the rest of the stay, she informed that it is “very likely” to recur because it may be a different person cleaning our room each day so she said we will need to call them every day if we want the extra toiletries! She also explained that rooms are not cleaned everyday but we can expect it to be cleaned the next day.Our room remained uncleaned the next day. For our entire 5-night stay, our room was only cleaned once. They only gave us the right number of toiletries on the last 2 days after we went down to complain again on Day 3 (not only for the insufficient towels but also for not replenishing toilet roll). Apart from service, the hotel room is dated and poorly maintained. The only saving grace is the housekeeping staff who delivered the extra toiletries on the 2 nights we complained. She is the only staff who sincerely apologised and offered a genuine smile. The other staff we interacted with appeared to be very rigid in their procedures and totally not guest-oriented.Things can go wrong but when there is no attempt in service recovery and ensuring it doesn’t happen again, it’s a reflection of poor staff attitude - be it due to lack of training or poor hiring.Date of experience: 13 October 2023","1"

The attendant did not even greet me and told me she will be back and disappeared. I had to be helped by another attendant after more than 5 minutes2. The first attendant returned and tried to interrupt the attendant serving me, saying that her customer was waiting. Fortunately, my attendant asked her to wait3. Concierge did something similar.

The room and the bathroom were big and clean. The only downside is the room has no windows but it has fixed double glazed glass panel. However, due to the stale air was trapped in the room, making the room smelt foul when checked in. Thanks to previous hotel guest's feedback, I came prepared with my own burner and essential oil.  We slept well because the room had black out curtains.   We are grateful the ""room service"" staff supply us a small electric kettle on request. The room come with a small fridge and a hair dryer. At the Hotel Lobby, there is a solo oil painting exhibition which ends in December 2023.

"1078","Trip.com is irresponsible for application of the refund of the Full Protection feeBackground: I rent a car with Trip.com (a travel booking website) in July 2023 and the car would be provided by AVIS (a rental car company) on August 11, 2023. Full payment has been made already by me.  The transaction was completed in July 2023.  The car was scheduled for picking up at AVIS in Amsterdam Schiphol Airport on Aug 11, 2023.  I arrived the AVIS counter and the staff told me that the reservation made for me by Trip.com was not in their system as a “prepaid booking”. Therefore, AVIS made a new contract (1853AN) for me instead. Some facts are:1.1 Trip.com issued the Rental Voucher with the confirmation no (starting 1959****) in July 2023;1.2 AVIS issued the Rental Agreement indicating clearly a Reference/external reservation no. (same no. as mentioned above) in August 2023;1.3 AVIS issued a letter and admitted that the reservation made for me by trip.com was not in their system as a “PREPAID” booking;1.4 Trip.com has charged me the full payment already and it is in fact a “PAID” booking; 1.5 Trip.com has apologized the inconvenience caused to me and agreed to compensate to me some money (20% of the booking order);Actually, Trip.com has got my payment already. However, Trip.com has made a reservation with AVIS’s system as a “not-yet-paid” booking but NOT a “prepaid” booking.Unfortunately, the car was broken down in the highway near the hotel (under 10 km) due to battery problem. Eventually, I contacted the AVIS the other day. AVIS informed me that AVIS was unable to provide a replacement car and agreed to cancel the booking. Since I have made a booking with Trip.com so I had to cancel the booking accordingly. I found the payment I paid to Trip.com consisting of 2 parts - the car rental fee and the full protection fee. Trip.com agreed to refund the car rental fee portion but refused to refund the full protection fee portion. Trip.com asked me to contact the insurance company directly. It took me a lot of time to find out the insurance company (RentalCover.com) and eventually got the refund successfully. I think that it should have done by Trip.com and not the customer.  Trip.com is irresponsible on this matter but have not yet explained it to me upon one of my requests.(Updated on Nov. 10, 2023)Date of experience: 11 August 2023","1"

Depending on the airline, they will not allow you to manage your booking on airline website and you can only do any add on through trip and they charged almost double. To put things into context, for a scoot flight from Haikou to Singapore, airline is charging about $31 for 20KG baggage add on while TRIP charges $74. The baggage add on confirmation was also not instant and delayed. Learnt my lesson and will prefer booking directly from airline moving forth.Date of experience: 08 October 2023","1"

I booked online some flight tickets that they NEVER emitted and refused to refound.Normally they would give you immediately the money back but not only they didn't...they just took my money, never emitted the tickets and wanted me to rebook another flight with MY money.I spent the money I had on the first flight  I bought, so how can I buy now a more expensive flight with the promise they would reimburse??? I need to reach a working destination. They cancelled the ticket without even confirming and didn't proceed yet with a reimbursement. They are not trustworthy and a real waste of time. Now I'm in a situation where I'm stuck without tickets and they are holding MY Money because they are unable to function and Provide the service they say they do.So I still need to buy a ticket to reach my working destination...it is getting more and more expensive..I'm gonna go to the authorities tomorrow to report the fraud ...also if someone of the audience has some legal advice or contact to sue them it would be very much appreciated.Editing my review after Kylie s answer.They are the WORST. They don't care and didn't give me any solution. They will hold the money of my tickets till October 12th... but I need to reach my destination by October 7th.This is a  FRAUD. They don't give a .... about the issues of the customers. It's their way or the High way....and btw the issues are totally created by them...worst company ever. UNABLE TO PERFORM.

I spoke to 3 other service representatives who didn’t demonstrate much willingness to help and just kept regurgitating policy, before I spoke to Samantha, who I’m so glad to have came into contact with. She actively and intently listened to all my concerns, upheld her professionalism and didn’t make any misleading claims, followed up my other friends flights to make sure all the information correlated. I feel she really went above and beyond to assist me with my concerns, I felt supported considering we are 3 young girls travelling alone, it was quite a stressful situation for us, to all be told different information from many representatives that wasn’t consistent, causing our travel plans to become disarrayed and incongruent. The exceptional customer service skills Samantha upheld made me feel supported and offered solution to the errors we were experiencing related to airlines & trip.com.

"1292","Thank you Lauren!I booked a car with Ace rental via Trip.com. It wasn’t a pleasant experience as the engine of the car was overheated by the 2nd day and Ace Rental was not willing to come over to my place to do a car exchange. I had to drive the faulty car down to the site to do an exchange. This led to a waste of time and disruption of travel plans. No apology or goodwill gesture was extended by them. Due to this issue, I was charged with hefty international calling bills. I emailed Trip.com for reimbursement of the bills and the response I got was bad. The customer support team refused to take responsibility over this issue and told me to contact Ace Rental direct for the reimbursement instead. I refused to do so and emailed them that they should be the one helping me with it. Another Customer Service officer checked with the supplier (I assume it’s Ace Rental)  and replied that my bills could not be waived. He further commented that they are a travel agency and have to abide by the policy provided by the supplier. Finally after sending a third email to Trip.com, Lauren handled my case and she did well. She investigated the case thoroughly and called me personally to offer a reimbursement of my international call fees. This was followed by an email. I was very pleased with her service as she did not brush me off like what the previous 2 officers did. 5 stars for Lauren but overall experience  2 stars.  Thank you so much for your help, Lauren!Date of experience: 12 September 2023","2"

Spoke to an online chat agent and all I got was “I’ll forward this on to the relevant team”. Inefficient and concerning since the payment for extra baggage was taken along with the payment for my ticket. Unacceptable service. Trip.com has lost my trust.Update: Turns out Trip.com took my payment but never booked my extra luggage. Now blaming the airline of course. No communication until after 8pm the night before my flight and only because I made the enquiry with a chat agent.I couldn’t make the purchase directly from the airline online and needed to pay at the airport resulting in double the cost! Save your apology and canned responses. Refund my money that YOU cost ME! …And not to your stupid trip coins, I want the different refunded to my card! 😤 Anything other that is zero customer service! I wish I could post images here! I have all the proof of your incompetence!Date of experience: 10 September 2023","1"

All my bookings went smoother and efficiently with all hotel bookings and flight proceeding without hitch or incident - 5 stars.On one trip with them had a notification from Trip.com, 4 hours before the flight that Philippine airlines (PA) flight was delayed by 1 hour and I would miss my Manila connection. I went to the airport for the flight and Spoke with PA duty manager got her name & I sent trip.com a WhatsApp reply that I couldn’t take this flight and in the msge I recorded my conversation with (PA).On my return home I contacted Trip.com and reported the flight delay again to them and asked what information they needed to place a claim for the flight.Cobain responded quickly by email and also telephoned me. I sent all the notifications and details with screenshots and explanation to Cobain. He was always courteous and polite and was patient and very helpful. We almost became friends.He told me that my claim had been assessed and he asked me for the E-ticket and cost for the alternative flight I purchased for me and my wife.Today we received an email from trip.com seeking my bank details and the payments has just gone into my bank account, even though it was  about 50% more expensive than the original flight - so Trip.com thank you so much - I’m very grateful.Excellent service and thank you Cobain for your assistance- best wishes, BernardDate of experience: 11 September 2023","5"

Trip.com got back to me saying “so it seems that it’s impossible for you to make your connection with the flight delay, would you like a refund on the second flight?” Therefore I didn’t even get my money back on the first flight of which it’s only purpose was to get me to my connecting flight.?? Very dumb right? Then I have to buy new tickets the day of at a crazy high price because they won’t change my flights. They basically gave me the middle finger. I ended up spending and additional $1,700 on tickets because of trip.com. I say don’t use them and just buy better tickets from Expedia or the airlines themselves.In response to your reply -You did not fix anything, you still cost me an additional $1,200 and left me stranded.

I had to book an alternative flight on my own, which they now don't want to refund in full. They only refund the cost of the original flight.

"1429","Booking confirmation by tripBooking confirmation by trip .com stated I’d pay $0 at car rental pick up. The rental agency charged me additional $172 US and said I had to pay these fees if I wanted the car.   When I sent the booking confirmation and receipt after returning the car as trip.com customer service asked, they just restated that I’d be charged the $172. I questioned why the confirmation stated that $0 to pay at pick up and there was no response. I asked if they contacted the car rental company and no reponse to that question either. The booking confirmation should have stated that extra fees apply, etc. Multiple replies from trip.con agents were unhelpful and useless.Date of experience: 11 August 2023","1"
"1430","I recently had the misfortune of…I recently had the misfortune of staying at a so-called ""Welcome Hotel by ITC"" hotel, which turned out to be nothing short of a disaster. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted by the overwhelming noise of construction and renovation. This was far from the peaceful escape I was promised.The amenities, which were a big reason for choosing this hotel, were completely unusable. The swimming pool and spa, advertised as the hotel's crown jewels, were under maintenance for the entirety of my stay. The atmosphere resembled a construction site more than a luxury retreat.I felt utterly deceived and disappointed. I'm not paying a premium price to navigate through scaffolding and listen to the unending sound of drills. The situation is unacceptable for any hotel, let alone one that claims to offer a five-star experience.I demand a full refund for the ordeal I was subjected to. Anything less would be an insult to the very concept of hospitality.Date of experience: 22 August 2023","1"
"1431","Satisfied with the app, the service and the offers.Generally, I have good experience with them. And whenever they offer better prices than other OTA, I book with them. The app is also well made with many good features and customer support generally good. I'm satisfied 9/10.To be a 10/10 they need to make sure that all information displayed in the app is 100% accurate. I had a situation booking an air ticket where it was not clear if carry-on is included or not in the airfare, and only after the ticket was issued I understood that the carry-on was not included. But with customer support we managed to solve the dispute with a positive outcome which in the world of air travel is extremely rare. So good job.

The agents on the hotline advised that I would hear a response in a few hours (at one point 30 mins) but that was never the case and I was to constantly chase over 2 days to eventually get a response.

I was immediately noticed as soon as I received the confirmation email and contacted to move my reservation by one day (I've contacted them 5 minutes after reservation). Support set in contact with me, but they kept telling me that they would come back to me in an hour, then in two hours, then in two days. In the meantime, I contacted the hotel to check if rescheduling is possible and they said that rescheduling is completely free of charge once. After two days, I received a reply from Trip.com that they could not reschedule, even though I explained that it was a mistake and that I had contacted them immediately. I also mentioned that I would accept other available date thank planned or voucher or any other type of settlement. They just left me to wait again and the day before the trip they announced that they would not move it without any further explanation.Date of experience: 21 August 2023","1"

"1562","Trip.com screws up and lets you sufferTrip.com forgot to email me and have me confirm the flights. They acknowledged later they failed to do this. Because the flights were not confirmed I couldn’t check in, check my status and select seats. I took a taxi early to be in time at the airport which cost me dearly (public transportation was not running yet). At all airports during my flight to the USA I was delayed and almost got stuck halfway. Very stressful. They promised going back would be better. No way. Issues again. Team leader Hatice made promises on the phone later but never got back to me. Remember, you will get every time someone else on the phone or answering your email. And, they have no clue so you are forced to repeat your story and questions. Better choose another.Date of experience: 23 April 2023","1"

"1602","Platform can be better. But what a great CS team!Not so good:(1) The platform is not user friendly enough for group bookings for hotels. If I need to book 2 rooms for 4 pax, e.g. 1 room with king/queen bed and 1 room with twin beds, I need to make 2 separate bookings. Cos I can only choose same room type for both rooms in a single booking. Booking.com can accommodate while Trip.com cannot.(2) The responsiveness of the support for certain requests depends on the how fast the booked hotel(s) responds. For e.g., I made a mistake for my first booking (booked for 1 night but wrong date, and want to modify the booking to the following day and extend 1 more night, i.e. total 2 nights instead) but after waiting for nearly 48 hours, still no resolution. But to be fair, the help support from Trip.com is very good - giving me regular updates that we are still waiting for the hotel concerned to respond.Good:Trip.com's customer support team is very very friendly and efficient.

Whether it's flights from different airlines, a wide selection of hotels, or diverse activities to choose from, they seem to have it all. It saved me the trouble of hopping between multiple websites and instead offered everything I needed in one place.The customer support team also deserves praise.

"1672","At least one customer service agent is on the ballTo begin with about 3 weeks ago I thought I would be awarding no stars.  On this site there are offers if you buy into something else. I was buying a railcard at a discount with the proviso i booked a hotel stay but  because the date was formatted with the day at the end I read 23.07.24 as July 2024 and thought great I'll have plenty of opportunity to book a hotel stay. Within minutes I realised my mistake and cancelled the transaction. Then I applied for a railcard with much less discount and to qualify I would have to buy a rail ticket. This suited me much better as of course I was applying for the railcard to book a train trip. However then having finished my transactions I looked at my account at trip.com. I had been charged for 2 railcards!  I wrote to customer services explaining the problem. They promised to sort it. Despite several emails I was just asked to be patient. Nothing was happening. Then I looked at my credit card bill yesterday and saw the full amount for the railcard had been taken. Why would anyone need two railcards?Obviously I was annoyed so I wrote again. On this occasion a young person called Chacha Xia was the customer services agent who helped me. I couldn't have asked for better service. I've been told they will try to improve their system so two identical items are not issued. They told me I could have a refund or credit so I am very happy.I have just booked another rail journey and it looks like I have saved about 10%.

Paid extra for choosing seats as usual and paid. After payment I went back to the search and saw the flights were back to the original price! Customer service no help at all refused to honour original price. Just to top it off got an email saying seat selection has failed you will receive a refund and have another chance to choose seats at check in.. (Still waiting for this refund) Very strange process. If you get a pop up during booking leave the page and use another provider like Expedia, usually similar price within a £ or 2.Date of experience: 06 July 2023","2"

Also I have to sort out my own tickets by visiting the airlines.  Plus one airline changed my flight time, so I then had to (not trip.com) change my connecting flight and they then charged me £57 for changing the flight!!--when they had done nothing.  Also I cannot get a straight answer from them regarding the tickets I am booked on i.e. light, economy, etc so I will probaly incur more costs for baggage as without the knowledge of my ticket I do not know the baggage allowence.

So, over a month after the airline cancelled my flight at the last minute I still haven't got my money back. Their customer service are a nightmare from hell and their highly suspicious requests for letters and personal photos (including my 12 year old daughter!) feel more like scammers trying to get my information than anything a legitimate company would ask for. They are blaming the airline for this and I don't believe it for a minute, and as I am in China now I will be paying Air China a visit, in person, to get to the bottom of this.

"1851","I regret that I can say nothing positive...I regret that I can say nothing positive about this hotel. It was very old and looked pretty beat-up. Though the hotel was non-smoking, we could smell the old stale cigarette smoke as soon as we walked into the room. It was embedded in the walls, the carpet, drapes and furniture. The air conditioner was dirty and very noisy. On top of that it did very little to cool the air. The water pipes made a screeching noise and would happen at random times, mostly when we were trying to get to sleep. We only saw one employee the whole three days we were there. I will never, never stay at this hotel in the future. The only reason we didn't leave as soon as we arrived was that we came into town to attend a function and this was the only hotel with a vacancy. I can now see why.Date of experience: 23 June 2023","1"

"1859","A Disheartening Experience: Lack of Transparency & Abysmal Customer ServiceI feel compelled to share my deeply unsatisfactory encounter with Trip.com. It is my sincere intention to equip fellow consumers with the necessary information to make informed decisions when engaging with this company.Regrettably, my interaction with Trip.com was marred by a distressing absence of transparency regarding fees and charges. Their website lacked the basic courtesy of providing upfront clarity and comprehensive guidance on the intricate structures of charges and fees associated with my bookings. This glaring omission left me bewildered and frustrated, as crucial financial details were deliberately obfuscated, making it impossible to make well-informed choices.Adding insult to injury, the customer service I received was nothing short of abysmal. The representatives consistently displayed an alarming inability to grasp the essence of the issues I raised, preferring instead to regurgitate pre-scripted responses that failed to address my concerns adequately. This robotic and disengaged approach only served to compound my dissatisfaction, as it was evident that genuine empathy and effective problem-solving were mere afterthoughts in their customer service strategy.My overall experience with Trip.com left an indelible impression of a business primarily driven by profiteering, with little regard for delivering the service and integrity expected of an honest enterprise. It is deeply disheartening to encounter such a flagrant disregard for ethical business practices in the travel industry, where trust and transparency should be the bedrock of every transaction.In light of these glaring deficiencies, I implore trip.com to consider the following recommendations:1. Prioritise Unambiguous Transparency: Trip.com must assume the responsibility of prominently displaying all charges and fees on their website, leaving customers with no room for confusion or ambiguity. Clarity regarding the financial implications of bookings is essential to engender trust and enable customers to make well-informed decisions.2. Overhaul Customer Service: Investing in comprehensive training programs for their customer service team is imperative. Empathy, active listening, and personalised assistance should be the cornerstones of their approach, ensuring that customer concerns are genuinely understood and appropriately addressed.3. Embrace Customer Feedback: Establishing robust channels for customers to provide feedback and actively utilising this invaluable resource to drive continuous improvement is paramount. By openly acknowledging and addressing customer concerns, Trip.com can begin to rebuild the trust they have lost and reclaim their standing in the industry.It is my fervent hope that Trip.com will earnestly consider and promptly act upon these suggestions to rectify the glaring deficiencies that mar their services. As discerning consumers, we rely on companies that prioritise integrity, transparency, and a genuine commitment to service excellence.I urge fellow traveler's to exercise caution when contemplating trip.com as their preferred travel provider, as my personal experience suggests that they may not uphold the standards of transparency and service one expects from a reputable company.Date of experience: 18 June 2023","1"
"1860","Don't Do itI booked a flight through here and the DAY BEFORE my flight is going to leave, I get an email from Trip.com that my flight was canceled by the airline. I sat on the phone with their customer service rep and she kept saying that if I book through the airline website and then send them an email they would refund me the difference. Hasn't happened and I'm afraid it never will. This place is a scam. They have terrible, unresponsive customer service, and I would never ever choose to work or book with them again. Please PLEASE save yourself the headache and book through the airline website itself.(July 2nd) Update: July 2nd was my return flight as I booked the trip as a round trip.

I had to pay $240 for a hotel at the airport and another $1004 for flights home the next day as trip.com does NOT follow through on their claims to help despite their flowery language. Then my claim for a refund was denied based on incorrect information given to them!!  I have provided proof of the correct information, including West Jet check in times and times of phone calls etc between a West Jet employee and her manager because I was in tears just trying to check a bag 7mins past cutoff. I was told they'd look more into it yet nothing... absolute radio silence.ETA: Well, someone got back to me but with the exact same incorrect information. They said that West Jet gives a 45min cutoff time yet it is 60mins for international flights. That info is in print on their website and I also lived it. There are phone records between a West Jet employee and her manager as she was trying to help me out when I was back at the check in counter for a second time at 1:37. If cutoff was 145 they would have been there when I was there at 130 as well as again at 137. They also said that the 2hr transit time was more than enough, yet it wasn't 2hrs, it was 60mins. The plane landed at 1230 and cutoff for West Jet check in was 130. Why they keep saying I had 2hrs is ridiculous. Then the bags were delayed coming off the first flight. This constant regurgitation of incorrect info would be laughable if it hadn't cost me so much stress and money. They also said that the delayed baggage was something I needed to take up with Air France...yet the Self Transfer Protection package that I paid for is supposed to cover ""delays"" that are out of my control.Date of experience: 01 June 2023","1"

(Screenshots of airline service chat to prove this)We called trip.com again (within 6h), and this time they said they will check. Turns out can reverse directions of the flight but they charged us an exorbitant amount!!!!!!Our flights were booked at $233 total. To rebook our flights, they sent us an email with a countdown timer charging us a total of $1053 (almost 5x the original!!!!!!) WHAT?!!! What if we didn’t check ?!!!

"1973","Trip.com is simply a scam. They keep your money for themselves when you cancel a bookingAppalling approach to ticket cancellations. They use some obscure generated email during booking, which they themselves cannot locate. They use their own card for payment.I canceled the tickets directly through Belavia Airlines, confirmed with their customer support the amount they reimbursed. In the end, the airline reimbursed over 80% of the ticket cost and provided refund receipts. Yet, trip.com has been ""unable to find"" this payment for a month and tells me that this airline does not refund money after ticket cancellations...Avoid this broken service, trip.com, like the plague.

I booked a trip from Tirana to Ibiza with a layover in rome as a whole trip - but what did they do…. They booked two separate flights with two different booking number.One of the flights changed the time which caused a very short layover in Rome. This happened to cause us frustration since it was sure that we would miss the flight. ITA AIRWAYS could not do anything about this because we had 2 separate flights and not a whole itinerary and mention that the agency should cover out needs.Those people are incapable of doing anything really. They call you a lot of time to speak like robots and say generic phrases like ‘we apologize’. While you need a solution to a problem you get nothing but generic emails and calls. This increases the frustration.NEVER BOOK THROUGH THEM - I LEARNED THE LESSON THE HARD WAY. A lot of distress for a fun trip to be!Date of experience: 31 May 2023","1"

"2016","Excellent experience since 2018So far I've booked flights, hotels, trains and tour tickets with the Trip.com app since about 2018. Just completed my largest trip with Trip.com to Africa, including flights/hotels.Initially I was nervous about using a brand I hadn't heard of before, but after at least 20 or 30 bookings - I've not had any negative experience, and haven't had to contact customer service once due to most of the easy self-service options in the app.The app is better than it used to be. Advice from seasoned traveller to others: read your flight or hotel policy before you do the purchase to avoid disappointment later. If you buy without reading, you are still bound to the terms of the policy. You are paying not just for a flight or the hotel, but you are also paying for the policy, a better policy which is refundable/changeable/includes breakfasts/more flexibility etc usually comes with a slightly higher price, but in my opinion is worth it.Date of experience: 13 May 2023","5"

I showed this terrible incident to the receptionist but apparently, he didn't care... I have a video and took some pictures of the nail as well as the duct tape I used to keep the bumper intact so that I can at least drive the car and get back to my home in Houston... The hotel staff charged my credit card against my will for $100.00 as an incidental charge to save their room from any damages if caused which never any hotel domestically or internationally charged... I am a very frequent traveler and no one ever did that except this hotel... The damaged bumper will cost me around $1,500.00 to fix it... The staff didn't apologize or showed any concern...

They don’t let you add baggage for specific travel providers, you need to go direct to them so why bother use Trip.com. When you do add baggage with the travel provider your confirmation email is sent to whoever booked the flight, which is Trip.com. I spent hours speaking to 2 different people on 2 different occasions trying to get the confirmation emails forwarded to me, and to change the email address from Trip.com to my own so I would receive future correspondence. Neither of these easy asks were able to be carried out. One of the agents actually tried to request more baggage through Trip.com even though I had told them I had booked it directly and only needed the confirmation emails. Had this request they raised been approved I would have been charged double what I had already booked directly. Don’t waste your time. Book direct.Date of experience: 27 April 2023","1"

Rather than tell me so I could either get a full refund or find an alternative flight home, they left it until the week before I left to inform me of the changes. This meant if I got a refund, a whole new flight would have been 4 times what I originally paid. And there was no availability on any alternative flight home. I had to pay for a one way ticket to get back. I am now having to email constantly to try and get my money back, this has been going on for 6 months. The advisors are so unhelpful and don't read my emails, I get sent template responses which aggravate the situation further and there has not been a single acceptance of responsibility to me being hundreds and hundreds of pounds out of pocket.

"2322","Their payment was refused at the hotel and I spent an hour trying to solve it.I booked a hotel at a great price and pre-paid, but upon checkout, was told that the temporary card number trip.com issued for my room was rejected. The hotel could not solve this problem because trip.com has no customer service phone number; it is only chat based. So the hotel was going to charge me their rate unless I could resolve this problem within an hour. Their chat service is hard to find, first of all, and kept telling me ""I don't understand"" when I asked for an agent. I finally got an agent, who wrote me in broken English and asked me for 30 minutes to call the hotel and resolve things. Then he wrote me back that the company they use to make payments to the hotel was closed because it was out of working hours in China. They would try again 12 hours later. That meant I was going to be charged $100 more than I'd already paid by the hotel, and I would have to try to get a refund if and when trip.com paid their part. I then spent most of my lunch with my family on my phone trying to get another agent to call the hotel and solve this right away. Another 30 minutes went by and the agent said again that to fix this, she had to contact their supplier to issue a new charge number for the hotel. In the end, I think she resolved it by convincing the front desk that they would solve it and not to charge me. The point is, when I should have been enjoying the end of my vacation and being with my family, I was stuck on my phone trying to fix this. I've never had something like this happen before. So buyer beware...I think this company got lucky enough to buy ""trip.com"" but is not well run and not very trustworthy.Date of experience: 08 April 2023","1"

There was a problem with baggage allowances, caused mainly by Ryanair’s confusing baggage policy which does not automatically include a carry on 10kg bag as you would expect from a professional airline. The problem was exacerbated by the fact that this was a connecting flight.Amy from customer services listened to and understood the problem which had caused me to incorrectly buy more checked in baggage than I needed in error while trying to add my carry on bag and a refund was given to compensate the mistake.I had one criticism in that their service tries to be too efficient and I was receiving too many notification emails. More than is necessary in my opinion. They have told me that they will look into this.Overall Trip.com offer a very good service and I would be happy to use them again.Date of experience: 06 April 2023","4"

Meaning paying for seat allocation on a flight but having passengers in different areas on the aircraft - not why you would ever pay an additional charge for seat allocation. But to kick it all off very, very inconsistent customer service, giving mixed messages, and getting basic booking details wrong. Very disappointing from a business perspective and a personal perspective. Common sense needs to prevail at some point. Please consider all other options before using this service.To make an additional comment - company have replied advising they have contacted me regarding my booking but I have had no contact from them at allDate of experience: 03 April 2023","1"

I tried to change my ticket and instead of getting my ticket changed directly, trip.com had to contact the airlines manually and hold your new date. They couldn't tell the cost of the changes as they didn't have this info. I wasted so much time tried to get in touch with them and after long conversation over the phone twice, they asked me to wait and cancelled the changes by email without explaining why. One of the requests expected me to wait 72 hrs and by that time, my seat could already be taken away. Later on, I was told over the phone that my ticket was cancelled due the airlines didn't accept ticket changes but afterward after purchasing a new ticket directly from airlines, I received an email telling me that I could change my ticket! I should already know this earlier if I booked from the airlines directly. Save your hassle, use the airlines directly instead of this travel agent. At least you can use the airlines website directly for any changes and this will be impossible if you use trip.com as the airlines won't let you to change through their website. This will just make any changes/cancellation to be more complicated. Price of the ticket is not much difference compared to the stress you've to deal with anyway!Date of experience: 27 March 2023","1"

The flight was first confirmed and then I got an additional email saying the luggage booking was not successful. Customer service could not support to add back the luggage. Also the request of refund was deniedAdditional comment on 25/3/23:The customer support from trip.com was useless. I needed to add the luggage myself. Paid 108$ for 23kg instead of 6.40$ for 46kg which was offered by trip.com. So the ticket almost became double price.The customer supportDate of experience: 09 March 2023","1"

"2532","Trip.Com came through for usThe bottom line is that Trip.com gave us 80 minutes to make a connection from Phomn Penh to Bangkok, Bangkok to Phuket. The flight left 5 minutes late but they SAID they arrived on time. We disembarked 15 min after the airline/Trip.com said we did. All would have possibly been Ok, as we were fast tracked through immigration but we stood around waiting for luggage. It arrived 30 minutes before our scheduled departure. We tried to check in 20 min before and were told we couldn't. Trip.com offered us $15 worth of coins as compensation for an extra $400 flight. I have been in contact with at least 6-8 people there- they are apologetic but that's it- they don't believe me and I don't know how i could document this - lesson learned.UPDATE:I was contacted by Max who said he would help make this situation better for us. He made us an offer and we are happy that Trip.com validated our experience. I had many back and forth conversations with him and we reached an agreement that we are happy with.

"2556","The $30-40 cheaper tickets aren't worth it.They didn't know about airline regulations for 24hr cancellation and mislead with price watch email. They also jumped the price up as I clicked submit payment by $100.  I booked for a trip which they spiked up price at last second. Got an email saying price went back down, but was unable to cancel through app so contacted virtually. The lady, Krishna, had never heard of the 24hr cancellation rule despite being in effect since 2020. I had to send link to gov website on rule and she confirmed, told me she was submitting emergency request because I had 10mins to cancel for full refund.  Once I got her okay, and at her urging to hurry up, I bought the ticket that my price alert had emailed me.  After booking it, I realized it was for the wrong dates that I had done the price change alert. Then got email saying they couldn't refund original tickets. I contacted again and was told that even though I just purchased, they couldn't refund the new tickets either. Contacted my CC company for help to dispute the second charge and Trips.com called me at 1:20am, apparently from India, asking me why I denied the charge. I explained the situation and was told that they only had record of the one ticket and no records of me ever contacting them. They told me I'd need to show proof.  One day later at 2:30am I got an email from them telling me that they had tried reaching me many times but phone and email and that If I didn't submit proof by next day, they would contact police, government authorities, credit bureaus and 'expose me for my fraudulent activities'.  They didn't even wait until next day to report to my credit card company.  So pretty much threatened me and called me a fraud instead of looking in their own records. The $30-40 savings is just not worth using this company.Date of experience: 02 March 2023","1"

"2569","DO NOT BOOKDo not book. The rates are low -cool- but no amount of $ is worth the headache and time you will spend trying to remedy an issue if any part of your travel goes wrong. My flight was cancelled by the airline - it happens. Because I booked through trip.com, they had to apply for the refund from the airline. Trip.com told me over and over again that they applied, but could not refund me because of the airline's policy. Complete lie! After weeks of back and forth, I reported the charge on my credit card since trip.com was demonstrating fraudulence (Capital One briefly refunded the charge while they ""investigated"" but then returned the charge and fully dropped the ball, insisting I work it out with the 3rd party and airline, ultimately not taking action in time to help me). So plan B: I eventually called the airline myself. They said that I was fully entitled to a refund for my cancelled flight, but there was no record of trip.com ever applying for my refund! It's an unbelievable scam they're running. This happened over 6 months ago. Still no resolution - just $700 robbed from me by this awful excuse for a business.Date of experience: 14 July 2022","1"

"2627","Trip.com - abysmal customer serviceBooked a flight from Sydney to London with connection flight in Hong Kong. Trip.com informed us the connection flight had been brought forward leaving 35 minutes to make the transfer. We asked them to contact the airline and change connected flight to one which left 75 minutes after our arrival in HK. Remembering we did not make the original connection flight change, after nearly 3 weeks of daily emails Trip.com have continually mentioned fees and have come up with GBP476 and GBP871 to move our flight in HK to the more achievable time. Even the fees indicate not a great deal of thought has been exercised in thi matter. Appalling service.Date of experience: 02 February 2023","1"

The MRT is also a stones throw away from the hotel. Staff are friendly and welcoming. I arrived at the hotel at 11:00 and was surprised and delighted that the room was ready (check in at 15:00) I did email before hand to ask if there was somewhere I could put my baggage and freshen up while I waited for a room and they did reply saying that there was. The room was clean, quiet and had all the amenities. There is a complimentary minibar that was stocked with cans of sparkling water, water and a chocolate barI didn't go to the pool or roof top bar so I cannot comment on this.The breakfast has a limited selection, but was enough to grab something before heading into the city.

"2694","Customer service at its best!!!I booked a couple of nights at a hotel in Paris for next week. Due to a general strike being announced yesterday for the 16th, (the day we were due to be travelling from Paris to Dieppe for a ferry connection), we would have been unable to get a train between the two locations and thus had to change our plans and book the second night nearer to the ferry. The 2 night booking that I had made originally had CLEARLY stated no refunds or cancellations, and I accepted that as the price of getting a good deal.I contacted Trip.com on the off-chance that they would allow me to move the second night to another hotel, not expecting much if I'm being honest. However, they not only delivered in allowing me to amend/cancel the booking but they couldn't have been more friendly and efficient at doing it! Pretty much within 12 hours of my initial contact (1800hrs UK time), my enquiry had been answered and dealt with.They may have lost the cost of 1 nights hotel by doing this but they have gained a customer for life so will reap much, much more as a result of this simple, common sense approach rather than a standard 'computer says no' or 'the terms and conditions say' type reply.

"2786","I booked flightsI booked flights, but requested a change flight option well in advance (3months). Once you select this change flight option on the app they only give you an hour to accept the change flight offer in their app. I was unaware of this hour limit, which I missed when I went to change again the change fee rose from 300 to 1160 euro, clearly trying to heavily penalise you and profit of their customers which is truly disgusting. I looked up the flight I wanted to change and it was the exact same price as the original flight I had chosen. I would happily pay the 150 euro change fee but to know they were charging you an extra 1000 euro for two flights which cost the same on the app is horrific. I would NEVER use this company again and I can’t stress to customers out their to use a different agency or to book direct with the flights it will save you money in the long run, I wish I had known in advance!I see below here that Trip.com have commented that they will take the time to message me privately - I am YET to receive this message1Date of experience: 25 January 2023","1"

"2795","Unprofessional advisors push back responsibilitiesYou already have a full back log history of emails between me and your customer advisors regarding the incident of my booking, so you can get all the details from there. Just to be clear, I was promised a quick refund but instead I had to exchange emails with 9 of your customer advisors (Lesley, Monika, Mike, Manny, Moataz, Abbie, Rebecca, Jennifer and Joy) and to each one of them I had to basically explain again the problem and formally request my refund. On top of this, I was also requested by them multiple times to personally contact the airline to check the status of my ticket, because apparently what the advisors were seeing in their system was not what the airline told me. Your advisors were not organized nor trained enough to solve my issue, they always tried to push back their responsibilities and made me lose a lot of time, especially because they made me explain the situation multiple times and also forced me to contact the airline twice.Booking issues can happen but in my case the situation was not handled professionally.The situation was so bad that I had to contact my lawyer to ask him to get ready for a formal complaint.Fortunately your advisor Joy contacted me and solved the issue in a very professional way just in time.I would give 5 starts to her but my experience with the previous advisors was so bad that I cannot give more than 2.Date of experience: 31 December 2022","2"

"2846","DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY AT ANY COSTDO NOT USE THIS COMPANY AT ANY COST. I wish I had read more carefully the reviews on several websites about trip.com before booking with them.  The majority of reviews detail truly awful experiences for travellers and I totally agree with them.  Although it was not this company's fault that United Airlines cancelled one of the sectors of our round trip to New Zealand, dealing with the aftermath of this has been horrendous.  To date, I have had emails from five or six different individuals, often impossible to decipher because of the poor level of English as well as two personal phone calls - one of which from the UK to the Philippines.  Emails asking me to confirm any possible changes within 30 minutes of receiving them have been sent at 6.30 am GMT when, of course, most people are unable to reply to them at that hour of the morning and who can reply to an email within that time limit anyway?  I cancelled the whole trip out of pure frustration and did receive a refund within a reasonable amount of time for the flights (around £4,150) but still have not received a refund for a VIP lounge (£63.00) booked for four people, despite trip.com assuring me that this has been returned.  To anyone considering using trip.com, please take my advice and do not do so.  It has been one of the most stressful experiences ever.  Trip.com agents kept repeating that United Airlines were at fault because of cancelling one sector of our round trip but surely, they as an agent, should take responsibility for dealing professionally with any issues and complaints like mine.  It goes against my better judgment to even award trip.com one star and I agree with many reviewers that they are not even worth this.  Take your business elsewhere future travellers when considering using trip.com.Date of experience: 14 January 2023","1"

A few days in to the holiday i checked our return flights and found they had been cancelled leaving us without a return flight! Again we had to pay for return flights at our expense. When we arrived home I applied for a full refund and compensation, they tried to penalise on the refund amount still saying we were no shows on the first flight.Over a month later they finally accepted that the flight had been cancelled and offered a refund that was £70 less than i had paid to them, still don't know why. Only compensation offered was in trip coins to the value of about £80. Will never travel with them again and I am beginning a settlement claim against them.Date of experience: 12 December 2022","1"

I was given a very specific additional amount I'd need to pay of £344.Called the airline who changed the check in status so I called trip.com again but was told their systems did not reflect the change and that I had to go back to the airline to make the changes to both my check in status and indeed the flights themselves.Back I went to the airline to be told everything I had been told by trip.com was inaccurate. Specifically, they could not make the change to the flight and that the check in status had definitely been updated.Back to trip.com who after fobbing me off back to the airline (which I refused to do since I'd just got off the phone to them) were then able miraculously to align the check in status but the additional flight cost was no longer £344 but had changed to £411 (almost £70 more than quoted less than 4 hours earlier).Nice little additional earner for someone !!!!!Made my feelings known about the additional amount, deleted the app and won't be going near them again.I have also discouraged friends and family from going near them, they have no sense of doing the right thing at all. A very short-sighted view trying to milk customers.The best businesses put their customers at the forefront but that seems to be the furthest thing from the minds of this companyDO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE if you want an acceptable level of customer service, integrity or fair treatmentThe fact more than 25% of the reviews on here are 1 star tells it's own story !!!! 🤬🤬🤬I agreed to pay the extra £411 just to get rid of themUPDATE 10.1.2023 am - I have now received an email where the amount has changed again. What started as an additional £343, going up to £411 2 phone calls later, has changed again now to £744.50 !!!!!!!!!!!!!This is the contact the responder below is seemingly referring to Their idea of help seems to be to ask for larger and larger payments the more you get in touch !!!!UPDATE 10.01.2023 pmThey are now trying to take the full flight cost because the email they sent in the middle of the night (without informing me to expect this email) was not actioned within the 1 hour window they give you.Their argument being the flight has taken off. I asked for the change before that, it's their fault for not telling me to look out for an emailWaiting to see if their escalation team can take responsibility and reimbursement the flight cost minus cancellation feesWill provide a further update once they get back to me.What doesn't help is that everyone I have spoken to at trip.com, English is not their first language so they are perhaps not able to understand the request / issue or it's getting lost in translationA total nightmare !The responder below claims to have emailed me for the booking details.This is completely untrue, I have searched through all my emails (including spam) and there is nothing from them with the exception of the emails I have already referencedStill waiting for the contact that Una below is talking aboutWould you like me to put my booking reference on here? Because you certainly haven't contacted me for it..........................Update - 11.01.2023 amReceived an email and provided booking number and contact detailsWatch this space........Update - 11.01.2023 pmThe 24 hour window I was told I would get a call in from the escalation team has come and gone...........Update 12.01.2023 amReceived a response that's not progressed anything just pretty much stating what I already know. My specific request of a phone call to discuss that has been made at least 3 times has gone ignored. They state they need another 1-2 days to continue investigating which is exactly the same as I have been told for the last 2 daysI simply want them to return the money less the cancellation feesI will be taking the issue to the regulators if they keep ducking around and refusing to see this matter to what is the fairest and easiest way to conclude thisWill provide more updates as they happen but nothing yet that's progressive........Date of experience: 09 January 2023","1"

Since we already booked an expensive accommodation in Sydney and couldn’t cancel that one, we booked a more expensive flight to Sydney the same night. We did that because we got a message from trip.com that we had 2 options: cancel the booking and get the money back (very reasonable), and change the flight to two or three days after. So we choose the first. It has been over 2 months and we still don’t have our money back. We contacted the flight operator jet star and they said they paid trip.com at the 8th of November.

I've called over 6 times, and there is never a manager or supervisor available to help. They've informed me that I bought two separate one-way tickets, which is a lie because I've never done that in my life. Also, there was only one transaction, not two separate. Also, I only put in my information one time because it was a round trip. If I bought two separate tickets, I would've had to put it in twice, and there would be two transactions. The customer service is completely worthless. They'll put you on 2 minute holds frequently for no reason. They have told me on 2 separate occasions that a manager will contact me in the next 72 hours, and that still hasn't happened yet.

I have been charged a change fee ($165AUD) for moving my flight by one day, and not even the airline itself charges for this (Cathay/Vietnam Airlines). I know this as my partner booked direct through Vietnam. It has been three days and three phone calls since I put in the change request, and I am wondering if they will even change it after assuring me it would be “expedited”. Anyway, they have 23 hours to do something, not holding my breath so I will just book a new flight with another airline in ten hours or so if they haven’t done anything.UPDATE: It appears that the flight has been changed according to the a phone call with the airline, however Trip.com are still yet to communicate this to me. I will amend the rating to two stars as such, however this communication is not good enough for 2022. Easier to manage this stuff by yourself.Date of experience: 24 December 2022","2"

You might paid your ticket a bit less but I would suggest to pay a higher  price and quality service than to pass through them. The customer service is extremely poor. They will openly lie to you until the last minute faking they are managing and solving flight changes/delays/cancellations when they are ABSOLUTELY NOT doing anything for you and could let you in a transfer country with no flight and no option. I am currently travelling from Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur with a stop in the Philippines, Manila. My original flight was on the 28th of December. The company informed me than the flight had been changed and the first flight from Tokyo to Manila was cancelled and rescheduled after the flight from Manila to Kuala Lumpur. (Kuala Lumpur being my final destination) - as the situation was not working and the second flight was now before the first one I was supposed to take they offer the only option to have a correspondance of 11H waiting in the airport of Manila. Indeed, a new flight on the 29th. As this was the only option I was oblige to accept anyway. Although they are not offering any service or compensation hotel or something for the wait, that is not the worst part; they NEVER sent me my new ticket of the 29th for the 2nd flight whether I asked they and was in discussion with them and their « chatbots » the three last days of my trip almost 2 times a day to make sure I would receive my ticket. They NEVER SEND IT TO ME telling me « no worry you are going to receive it in 24h, 4h from now » always finding new excuses and time delays. Then come the day of my trip where I receive the email that my « change request flight » couldn’t be taken into consideration and had not been accepted indeed. When you will try to contact them, they will just tell you to deal with the company and that they cannot do anything. now I will be stuck in Manila I don’t know for how long, I don’t know when I could get a new flight - SO PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE THAN ME. DO NOT TAKE THIS COMPANY unless you are willing to be stuck in a country, you don’t know for how long and have no information on it. I normally never write reviews but as a young woman I am feeling personally extremely affected by this situation as it could also be pretty unsafe and I just prefer warn other people that might be affected like me.Date of experience: 27 December 2022","1"

"2934","The Trip.com Travel Debacle: A Cautionary Tale of Wasted TimeI booked a flight with trip.com 6 months in advance from Melbourne to LA, and after 3 days of talking to 8 different people, they forced me to refund my flight due to a scheduled flight change by the airline. I had booked this flight over 5 months ago, so when I got the call that I would miss my connection in Auckland, I was hopeful that trip.com would be able to get me on another flight. However, I was extremely disappointed with the service I received.Trip.com has a policy stating that if they need to do an 'involuntary rebooking' of your flight, it must be with the same airline. This proved to be a huge issue for me, as the original airline had no available flights because it is the Christmas holiday. Despite working with trip.com for 3 days to get on a flight with Air Tahiti Nui, each change request took over 24 hours to hear back on. They assured me that they had marked my situation as urgent, but I never heard back before 24 hours had passed. Because of this, three of my change requests were canceled.Even though I had paid for this flight months ago, trip.com refused to rebook me on another flight after it was clear that the original airline had no flights available. In one instance, I spent over 3 hours on the phone with trip.com (I promise this is not an exaggeration), trying to understand why (given the circumstances) they wouldn't rebook me with a different airline. I went from willing to work with them to absolutely furious, demanding that they sort out my flight because my scheduled flight was due to leave in 12 hours. Yet they wanted to put in another change request which I would have to wait another 24 hours to hear back about. No. Instead, all they did was repeat their scripts, apologize, and say ""I'm very sorry"" and ""I know how you feel."" Each person I spoke with followed the same script.I will never recommend trip.com or Air Tahiti Nui to anyone. They're unreliable and wasted hours of my life. All they will do is reply to this review with empty words and promises, saying things like ""we will contact you directly"" and ""address your concerns,"" just like they have with all the other negative reviews on this site. But the fact remains that they never made this right and offered no solution to rectify the situation. They took away the opportunity for me to see my recently widowed father and wasted hours of my life. Trip.com should have rebooked me with another airline and absorbed the costs, as it was not my fault that the original airline changed my flight. You could argue that it isn't theirs either, but they had 3 days to fix this, and they didn't. They are a travel agency; their business is working with their partners to sell tickets and assist in travel. Isn't rebooking a flight ticket after an airline scheduled change the most basic of tasks for them? In the end, they refunded me, yet I still lost a lot of money I had spent on bookings for my trip. Avoid trip.com and Air Tahiti Nui at all costs.UPDATE: Note their response below, following the same script for all the other reviews here. Fun fact, they haven't contacted me.Date of experience: 20 December 2022","1"

It's difficult to unsubscribe and they send several promotions per week. They literally go out of their way to punish you for using them. The more you use them, the more often you must unsubscribe from their torrent of marketing garbage.I travel for work. No amount of advertising or deals will make me buy a single ticket. Yet I get subscribed to the entire menu, duplicated across app push notifications and email, every time I touch the app. Please stop.It's a genuine pity because it's a good app and good CS team. The only thing the CS team has not been able to help me with is preventing the auto-forced resubscribe.After tolerating this for a few months, booking more than 15 flights on here, and quickly becoming diamond tier, I must concede defeat and turn to another booking app. They have tried their hardest to make to leave so I shall. I have spent down my points and deleted the app.The reason I gave one start for this is that it's such a simple thing to get right and they're deliberately getting it wrong. It says a lot about how much they care about the users.Edit: I'm very tired of support staff telling me I can turn off notifications in the settings page. I know. The problem is it turns back on automatically when you make any purchase. I'm not missing any sneaky ""I'd like to receive marketing"" check boxes, it just turns back on. Very abusive experience. May aswell not have the setting.Also should note this is not an ""improvement"" that can be worked on. Forcing the notifications back on is a very deliberate choice and action on the behalf of Trip.com. you could ""improve"" it in literally seconds by just not overriding the user preference.The only two honest responses are 1. Yeh we know we're forcefully overriding your prefere, we know you hate it and we don't care.2. Ok fair enough, you got us. We'll stop screwing with youDate of experience: 15 December 2022","1"

"2975","Will never book with these againWill never book with these again, booking process is misleading when booking baggage. Booked 2 bags on at higher price than what airline are charging (found this out after booking). When I confirmed baggage that I thought was for the round trip I then discovered they were only booked for outbound. At no stage was I prompted about this so came as a big surprise to discover that after paying £124 for 2 bags I needed to pay for return flight. I called their customer service team to raise this matter but it fell on deaf ears and was just told it would be escalated and I would receive an email within 24 hours. I then received an email about half hour later that just quoted the standard baggage policy so no further forward. I ended up booking the return baggage through the airline at a cheaper price. My advice to other customers booking flights is to avoid this company as they are not transparent and more expensive in the long run.Date of experience: 08 December 2022","1"

The Trip team took on the case and despite across multiple customer service agents, the quality of service and genuine customer care came through in every interaction with me. I paid the $50 USD name change fees but to my suprise, the agent not only fixed the problem and helped me check in, they also ensured they got me a full refund from the vendor. So at the end I was not out of pocket and had a successful check in. I am flying happy tonight thanks to the trip team and especially Rachel Wang who was spectacular.

The representatives which were Arab, likened their responsibility to zero, and simply removed themselves from liability in the words.As is stated, it is obvious that their system is responsible, therefore they are also responsible for corrections of errors.Upon two further conversations, one woman, Arab also, said they will send(posalju) an email, and the next person, said it takes 10-5 days to investigate, in which time flights may become occupied, or prices increase.They did mention 10-5, referring to their intention to claim Jewish writing style as their own, and also demonstrating their present intent to control the future.They also did demonstrate the ability(rather intent) in speaking angles bilingually, and therefore prove that Arabic was not the gifted language of the creator.As some information here may not seem relevant to the topic at hand, to the uneducated or unaware, it is absolutely relevant.They wish to cost the world everything, and have the world give everything to them.Date of experience: 26 November 2022","1"

You know what its easier to book directly with Qantas - it might cost more (actually by the time you get ripped off - works out to be the same, but the time wasted dealing with issues caused by trip.com far outweighs the benefits and worry free travel that the other airline provides.

"3035","At your own riskThe website and booking process is fine, but then you can say that of every other such aggregator. If you want to risk it and hope nothing goes wrong, you'll get a perfectly serviceable deal. However, when something does go wrong, the customer service is absolutely dreadful. It took them four months to produce a refund after the airline had sent it (FlyBe, who have excellent agents in contrast). The responses I received were barely recognisable as English, constantly asked that I be patient for days on end while they resolved this apparently fiendish problem, repeated the same excuses in multiple threads, and decided on the airline's behalf that they were experiencing Covid delays, which I suspect they may just have made up having not heard anything like that from the airline directly. My advice - go with someone else, there are about 20 alternatives and some, I assume, employ intelligent, literate people.The date of experience is when my flight was first cancelled. I am writing this in later November, thankfully of the same year, at leastAddendum: No, Trip, I will not be emailing about my concerns.

No one was there to help. No managers were ever available. I waited on the phone for over an hour for a supervisor who could not help me. When I asked to speak to his manager he asked me what the purpose was. I usually never leave negative comments but I found it imperative to deliver this message as I am beyond disappointed in the quality of service I received. The manager Hakeem told me to to pretty much get over my troubled situation and he can help me moving forward despite all the agents inability to help me out and the run around I was given for two weeks.Date of experience: 15 November 2022","1"

Thank you Kenzie for taking time and addressing my concerns. 5 stars for Kenzie.***************Flights delayed for almost 2 hours. They charge over $1,000 fees per passenger + fare difference to change the delayed flight. They say it’s airlines policy but I called the airlines and was told that no fees should be charged since it’s involuntary change due to delayed flight. I called trip - no help over the phone they always say they will email. Too many email exchanges without help. Don’t use trip.com!!!!***** 11/13/22 update… just saw trip.com’s response here that they tried to contact me directly —— not true!

"3066","Cancelling and customer serviceI made a mistake on my booking for the return flight but had not bought any cancellation insurance. I called customer service and waited over one hour on hold (with only 6 calls before me). Then the person could not help me and suggested I call the airline directly. I am told that in Quebec we can cancel our bookings if made within the last 24 hours. Your organization should be aware and provide this service to us rather than direct us to the airline customer service. I should have been able to cancel directly with Trip. Furthermore, when I called the airline they would not make the change for me because I could not confirm the email address and phone number used for the booking. Even though I had provided Trip with my info it registered an email address and phone number irrecognizable to me and so the airline could not help me. This latter part was frustrating and unacceptable. Your system should provide the airline with the customers' contact info and not with some default email and phone number.Date of experience: 10 November 2022","2"

I most recently booked at hotel for one night, I wanted a brand name hotel, as I had been staying in random places and this was my last night. I found the hotel I wanted, used instant confirmation, paid, received booking number, and then was on my way to the airport to fly to the city I was flying out of the next day. Well…1.5 hours before my plane takes off…I get an email, telling me my hotel is cancelled and I need to find another hotel. Here’s the problem, I have not gone through security yet, I checked my phone just before I went through. Thank goodness! Well I call, and get put on hold, for 10 minutes…I hang up and go through security as I don’t have time to waste. I contact an agent via the chat feature, and he spends the next 40 minutes booking a new room. Took far too much time when I could have just booked a new room myself. But I did appreciate that help, just super slow when you are about to get on a plane to a city you DO NOT have cell service. And therefore don’t have a way to book a hotel. I wanna like trip, but every time I try you do something that makes me never wanna do it again. If your prices weren’t low, I’d never bother with this site again. Maybe I will just start paying a bit more for better service in the future.Date of experience: 10 November 2022","2"

Although it was due to the airline, Trip.com took ownership of the issue and refunded me the costs involved. Not only did Trip.com refund the airticket fare, they also compensated me partially for the incidental expenses arising due to the flight cancellation (food, accommodation, alternate travel costs). I am quite happy with the customer care team at Trip.com, especially Ms. Aggie Yu - who finally resolved the matter. Also I noted that the responses (or the reply emails) are quite immediate & prompt from Trip.com. The delay was only for the refund/ compensation (but was settled finally).

Each time they tell me that they are waiting for the airline to return the money and they will then refund me. However, as stated above, the airline said that there was no booking. I bought the flight via Trip.com - so they are the ones responsible for refunding the money to me. My contract was not with the airline - it was with Trip.com, who are in breach of contract.This has been going on for nearly 4 months. Despite regular requests from me to refund the money, it's clear that they have no intention of refunding the money and they are hoping I will give up my regular requests for a refund. I have given them plenty of notice to tell them that if they don't refund the money, I will share this experience on social media.

I sent all documents they need. Since day one they kept email me my request on process its take 24 hrs to review. So I called them again because I don’t get any answers  Besides they keep saying is on process its take 24 hrs. 7 days an a row that what Response I got. Even when I called they always telling me don’t worry ur request is priority and promising me and giving me a hope my issue will solve. Even I request a supervisor to talk to, 3 times different day, they keep saying no supervisor available because their busy dealing another customer and they will put request to call me but no one call. Then the day before my flight I still don’t  get any solution. I called them many times then finally this this time I got something different answer, take note, this is the day before the flight, so they want me to pay $51 for name amendment and I did pay to just solve the problem, then later I called them to follow up to make sure everything ok, but the agent said they will follow up to relevant advisor because she don’t know what the result.  Then the day of the flight I got email from trip site saying my request was denied by the china airlines. So they sent me a link to pay but means not guarantee that’s gonna work. I don’t get it! This is ridiculous. So I called them again. And again they giving me a hope and they will promise they will find alternatives option, they will contact me as soon as possible. Then 7 hrs before my flight I got email from the trip site my flight was cancel automatic  by the airlines. I called the airlines to verify myself. China airlines told me the agent name Vella from trip..com called them and having conversation regarding the issue. Wow! They cancel my flight without my knowledge. Then its getting worst trip site email me and want me to voluntarily cancel my flight and pay $776.00 and just book a flight directly. First the flight was canceled already, so you want me to cancel so they can charge me. Wow!! This ridiculous. First You are going to refund my money  because I did not cancel it. You don’t even solve my problem and you have a nerve to charge me. If I know you can’t solve the problem, I just go straight to the airport and deal my self about the issue, may be it will solve when I get there. But is no way to me now to go there because my flight was canceled.  You have no Idea how you guys did damage, I can’t even sleep. Apologize is not helping me.

Wonder how companies are allowed to make money and not fulfill promises. Gutted.  Wish could give 0-star rating here.Hi Scarlett.Please don't bother doing anything because your whole organisation is very incompetent, misinformed and need a lot of help with educating with your organisation's own terms and conditions and also rules and regulations of the travel industry.

I asked if I could cancel and I was told it was not possible but they would check.I then received emails addressed to OTHER CUSTOMERS with their full contact details- GDPR breach!I contacted Trip.com about it and I have now been waiting more than 10 days for them to confirm if my data has been leaked too (as my boarding passes were being sent to an email I do not recognise nor own) Appauling experience.One day AFTER my return trip they called me (someone called Colvin that was super lost with the case and did not even check the dates of the journey) and they wanted to discussed the cancellation (they already told me I can't do and I have already travelled). This company is a JOKE that breaks consumer and Data protection laws. AVOID!Update: 15 days now since the Breach but their privacy department went quiet.

The airline wouldn't allow a non-student to book this ticket so I'm not sure why the travel agency does 😢 I've had to call customer service multiple times and they keep telling me to wait. Shout out to Jessica, Joshua and Chloe (the agents that helped me) for trying their best to help. As a new user this has been a terrible experience and I regret not directly booking with the airline instead. As my issue hasn't been resolved yet, I hope trip.com takes better care of their new users and don't let them have such a hassel ridden first time experience.Edit: After checking my booking confirmation and receipt again the details never mentioned anything about my purchase of a student ticket. Eventhough it's my fault for mistakenly booking (though I was confused as a new user) I have now had to pay for the cancellation and rebook. This has been a first time for me and I will never ever be using trip.com, anyone reading this please book your tickets directly with the airline and avoid all travel agencies like this - save yourself anxiety and disappointment.

"3175","Mis-sold flights, and refused to engage with complaintsThis company sells flights which do not exist.I booked a return ticket from Hong Kong to Brisbane for the Christmas period, so I could see my family at Christmas. At the first business opportunity (booked Sunday night, this occurred Monday morning), these flights were changed from being relatively quick and short to giving an absurd 24hr+ transfer time for both the outbound and return flight. Given the immediacy of this change to my booking, it's clear the original flights were mis-sold. Whether this is down to the airline itself or Trip.com, the fact is that as the seller, Trip.com has a responsibility to offer flights as advertised. It certainly doesn't cover normal cancellation policies, as I am demanding money back for a product that was not sold as advertised. However, Trip.com are wanting to charge around 75% of the initial fee to cancel the flights, despite being at fault for the cancellation. Worse, they have refused to respond to my attempts to contact them regarding this matter. I offered a choice of a refund or a chance for them to fix their mistake by contacting the airline and changing the flights back to the originally booked seats (if they even existed in the first place).

Trip have now sat on this payment for several months and have refused to pass on this refund to myself. They even lied to me to say that Ryanair had only provided 'Airline vouchers' for a future flight, but when I again checked directly with Ryanair they confirmed it wasn't the case and they had refunded Trip in cash.Every time I chase for an update I am sent between different teams and constantly told to wait 'two weeks for next update due to Covid delays'.Trip are trying to waste my time in the hopes that I will get bored and decide not to keep pursuing this refund.

"3194","DO NOT BOOK WITH TRIP.COMI am a recent DIAMOND tier member with Trip.com after booked many bookings for flight, hotel, car rental for myself, family and friends just within a month. My experience started with one incident where I booked the flight with a wrong name spelling due to auto correction on my phone. It was simply mistake and I found that out 1 MIN after making payment. While ticket is under issuing (system said 2hours to isssue the ticket), I contacted Trip.com right away and told them about my issue. Staff told me they cannot make any modification due to the booking status. They advised me to wait until the ticket is issued, then they can make change  ( I have chat converation for this mishandling and irrelavant information provided by staff). I contacted them back 30 mins after receiving ticket to my email. From there, I was surprised that they informed me about the name correction fee. Instead of instructing me at the first place, to cancel and make a new purchase since booking had not been issued - BUT THEY DONT DO SO. I forced to agree to pay the fee at 1500 Thai Baht eventually. After 3 days, they came back to me and asked me to pay another 1000 Thai Baht becuase they gave me wrong price. What a waste for 3 days! Again, I forced to pay the extra. It has been now a week and during this time, I have receiving more than 10 emails asking me to wait patiently and it takes 72 hours to process......and kept telling 72 hours for a week now. I was shocked to receive the last email from them asking me to contact the airline directly and they will refund me the correction fee! what a waste of 1 week!!!I did called Thai Airways and they were very helpful...the information was also shocking to learn that airline has processing the request but only wait for Trip.com to reconfirm....this is LACK OF FOLLOW UP from Trip.comStoping sending me email and start to follow up with airline I suggest. If I would know this, I would better contact airline directly for change.

Our stay was from Friday-Sunday, prepaid.We requested a late check-out at the time of our arrival and were told to come back the next day to ask. We did just that and again we were told to call or come down to the desk after 9am on the day of check-out to make this request, which makes zero sense. It was like pulling teeth to get an answer. When checking out, we called the front desk 4 times before someone answered and then we were put on hold twice. We were only calling to ask how to check-out.

I booked a self transfer flight with insurance to get total refund if first flight is cancelled or delayed. First flight got a delay of 8 hours 44 minutes, I have been contacting them for weeks, they said the airline didn't approve the delay, while the airline sent me a delay confirmation. Customer support is just horrible, always reading scripts saying ""as much as I want to help..."", ""we will reach to the relevant team and get back to you in 24 hours..."". NEVER BOOK THROUGH THIS COMPANY EVER. They don't care about the customers, all they care about is customers money even if the service is not delivered.They asked me to contact the airlines, or the insurance (where they provided me twice numbers that don't work), they asked me to reach out to airhelp. When you book, you book all through trip.com, when it comes to getting your money back, they ask you to reach other parties. What a horrible service and horrible customer experience! They are not willing to take any step further to approve the delay and issue the refund. At this point, I believe THEY NEVER REFUND. If CUSTOMER SUPPORT is telling me my assistance is limited, if CUSTOMER SUPPORT is not able to SUPPORT A CSUTOMER, then any minute you will spend on the phone with them is a wasted minute from your precious life.

In the early morning, 9 am, I realized my family was LIIN on the ticket and it should be LIN. I contacted trip.com for the name amendment. They ask me to contact China Airlines (CA) London branch who can help. I did. However, London CA said ticket was issued by trip.com, I need to contact trip.com. London CA sent the mail to trip.com for name amendment request ( including me in cc), no one answered. London CA also said trip.com not contact them today. About 4pm, trip.com suggested me go to airport to do the name change. When I get LHR, airport said that I need to ask the travel agent, trip.com. I finally called trip.com at 8pm again, trip.com said I should request the name amendment earlier and trip.com had tried their best to help me. The ticket is about £1250, if I am willing the cancellation I will get £345 refund. If I reschedule my flight 2 days later with trip.com, I need to pay trip.com £1000. Sounds ridiculous, right? But it is indeed trip.com policy. The funeral of my grandmother is on 29/9 and I really miss it due to this situation. In the past 24 hours, I have mail, online chat, call with a lot of trip.com people. No one really solved the problem, they always said they are processing my request, be patient. But I never know who processed it for me. Finally I lost the flight and they said I should do the request earlier. The people who answered me can’t do anything for me.

As a responsible travel agent they need to notify about this condition and talk to that airline staff who refused us and arrange us our new tickets or full refund. but they are just telling us we need to follow airlines rule then why did you take money from us let us directly talk to airlines if you guys do not know how to do business and manage your customers. And the other Malaysian Airlines staff at the airport just refused us with providing us any written reason after asking so many times as we just did not book our 2nd flight from same airlines.

They purposely put that you can move your flight for free when booking so you feel safe giving your money to them but it's a blatant lie.Trip.com did nothing to help in the end I lost over £300 for the flight. When booking the flight they stated that the flight could be rearranged for free before the end of September but as I've said above this is a complete lie and they quoted me over £800 to change. I will never use this company to travel again,they are extremely misleading.Trip have stated they have handled it accordingly but all that have done is pass the blame onto the airline,they have not once answered why they lie about being able to change flights with not charge, any response by trip.com on here is trip trying to make themselves look better in this situation.Again they are stating that I'll receive a refund to try make themselves look better in this situation but the refund quoted is £17, a fraction of what I paid and again there's no explanation as to why I was quoted £800 when they say when booking that flights can be rearranged for just an admin fee.Date of experience: 14 September 2022","1"

I'd say though that the general Trip support system isn't working well to communicate with customers and properly act on their behalf as travel agent.My first response was that my request wasn't possible and there was nothing that can be done. The suggestion was to wait and see if a name change with the Airline on the day of a flight were possible. I don't see this as a solution anyone could accept.Why I say this is an issue with general Trip process is that there is clearly no extra effort encouraged/allowed to actually resolve issues. I have since been told that some phone calls were made on my behalf, but no emails were sent.When a name change amendment requires passport scan and written details of the name amendment, I would think sending an email to resolve an issue wasn't too much too ask.Date of experience: 07 September 2022","4"

When I received the confirmation a few hours later, the return trip was shown as October 12.  I contacted trip.com as soon as I could the same day to explain the problem.  They said they would check into it and get back to me.  I did not hear from them by the next evening so I called a customer service representative to explain the situation to them.  They said I was changing my flight and since I did not pay a change fee, I was stuck with the tickets.  I said I was not changing my flight - I did not receive what I had requested and had informed them of it in a matter of hours.  They said there was nothing they would do for me.  My efforts to deal with the situation through the airline (Westjet) and the travel consolidator (Voyzant) did not assist.  Although they were both very sympathetic, they said their arrangements with trip.com did not allow them to intervene.  Trip.com has total jurisdiction over the matter.  It appears I will now have to purchase two extra tickets and there will be two empty seats on a trans-Atlantic flight.  Our apparent good deal with trip.com was not such a good deal after all.  I recommend being very careful if you decide to book with trip.com.  You may not receive what you requested, and immediate requests to rectify an error may be disregarded once payment has been made.UPDATE - Despite the nice reply I received from trip.com below, they advised me directly that there was nothing they could/would do to fix the problem.

"3342","Read the reviews before buyingI should have read this company's reviews before booking my flight from London to Tunisia.Apparently, this company gives themselves unfair advantage by booking a connecting flight that is IMPOSSIBLE to make. Then to deceive their customers and calm their fears, they clearly state in their policy that they will rectify any missed connection. If you would think, they know what they are doing, and they care about their reputation, you will be proven wrong.This kind of behaviour is wrong and should be reported to the appropriate search engines and governing bodies. This company is registered in Singapore, and will probably be beyond the reach of your local  authorities, so be very careful who you are buying from!In my case, they sold me a connected flight with 1 hour connection time. Needless to say, this time is impossible to make and I lost my connecting flight. I had to buy a whole new ticket and stay overnight in a foreign country. Moreover, and because of the missed incoming  flight, I lost my return ticket, and was left stranded in Tunisia without a way back.

"3343","A lot of frustration while trying to rebook my flight due to covidI booked a ticket from Trip.com flying to Hamburg from Singapore and Flying back from London to Singapore. Due to covid my flight was canceled at the very last minute and when I approached the agent I was told I would get a full refund. So I did not claim my insurance but when the email came from Trip.com it was stated to me that they will not be able to refund me but the value of my ticket will be kept in the ticket number and that if I want to rebook a trip I must book through their agent and I am not to do it from the online booking. From what I understand meaning my new booking could cost much more than what I can find online on Trip.com.I tried to book a flight earlier this year  in January and was told by the agent that there were no available seats for my July flight. All they have left were premium seats that cost me a lot of money.I tried again today to reach out to them, I get a standard answer from both agents that attended to me that they are bound by the rules of the airlines.That I am to book through their agents and that I cannot book online through their website. That seemed to be their excuses and I requested that if the agents were unable to assist me then refer me to a higher management who can make decision of my case.I regretted not buying the ticket directly from British Airways as I would be given a voucher immediately that I can use partially or totally and the remaining left value can be used for future booking.I am highly disappointed with how Trip.com handle this situation due to no fault of ours since covid has affected so many people and we had paid the full amount of $1.2K two years ago to Trip.com and up till today I still cannot utilise the ticket.I would never ever book another ticket from Trip.com and would discourage friends and family to do so.Date of experience: 18 August 2022","1"
"3344","Major lack of responsibilityAbsolute disgrace of a service. Never ever trust Trip.com. A booking was made from Edinburgh to Porto with a connection in Mallorca with only 1 hour to the connection. now, I know my first flight was delayed by 1 hour 40 minutes so i knew i would miss my connection anyway but when I landed, I found YOU HAVE TO EXIT THE PALMA DE MALLORCA AIRPORT AND RE-ENTER FOR CONNECTING FLIGHTS (THIS CANNOT AND I F***ING REPEAT, CANNOT BE DONE IN 1 HOUR). It took 20 minutes for the landed plane to let us out, then 20 minutes to get out of the airport and then you have 2 hours waiting line to get back in (YOUR OWN TRAVEL POLICY INSTRUCTS YOU TO BE AT THE AIRPORT 2 HOURS BEFORE YOUR FLIGHT; so why did you not apply your own policy here???? there should be a 2 hour MINIMUM before the next flight). I made this booking with full trust in Trip.com believing the flight was actually from another gate inside and would not have to exit and re-enter, that can be made in 1 hour yes. On Trip.com they mention ""if there was a mistake made by ourselves we will issue a full refund"" what a pile of lies and customer entrapment.I phoned your agent to chase up with my old claim and to rectify this problem I've run into to make sure that NO FUTURE CUSTOMER will fall for the same thing but got the response of ""SIR! we don't set the times, the airlines do!"" sure they do, but if i'm making a booking for you that will 100% fail leaving you stranded because ""the airline believes that's enough time to make it"" it's common knowledge that there are massive delays in airports, I would have never made the booking had i known I would have to leave and re-enter the airport. This is the very same airline (RYANAIR) that refused to claim responsibility that there was a delay. it took me 4 days just to get them to send an email out to confirm the delay. when i called ryanair, i was also told to claim through the place where i made the booking and vice-versa when i went to trip.com they drop all form of responsibility and tell me they're only following the airline's guideline. Absolutely zero responsibility from Trip.comI've had screenshots FROM RYANAIR APP notifying the delay but that was not enough for Trip.com, and unless ryanair confirms this delay, i would not get any form of compensation. It's like dealing with children.Final verdict; Avoid at all cost, they will assure you that you will be compensated and are covered if things go south but when they actually do... they will avoid all forms of responsibility and delay your claim for as long as possible. on top of this, the insurance provided by Trip.com leaves you stranded for 1 hour 30 minutes before anyone even acknowledges your existence.

"3348","TRIP.COM site booking issue led to double charge followed by TRIP.COM lies to keep money takenWe were looking for the round trip flight for my wife's trip to seminar in Budapest for exact days (11th of August - 15th of August). The suitable Ryanair flights were found through the SkyScanner with the reference to purchase at TRIP.COM, which had the best rating between other agencies (later it cleared out that both SkyScanner and TRIP.COM belong to the same financial company). We chose to book, but as soon as the booking payment was made for the 11th of August and 15th of August, the final TRIP.COM booking summary showed the departure flight dated 12 of August. We immediately used the ""Cancel/Change"" option on the TRIP.COM booking, changed the date to the proper one, double verified it and chose ""OK"". The TRIP.COM took an additional charge. We expected to pay the fee for the change all though it looked to be the TRIP.COM site glitch, but the charge size was suprisingly big - almost equal to the one taken for the previous round trip. The wrong date flight was shown as ""canceled/waiting for refund"", but the airfare company was still showing the flight as ""booked"" (verified directly with the airfare.company representative, who claimed the responsibility for the problem to be fully on the TRIP.COM). To be on the safe side I contacted the TRIP.COM by phone, explaining the situation and asking why I saw three flights instead of two and when will be the refund. The TRIP.COM representative confirmed, that ""we have only 2 flights for the correct dates, that the wrong date flight is already canceled and that the refund (in proper size) will be returned in 5 business days"" (call recorded!).In the end it came out that no flight was canceled, every mail reminder about the officially promised refund for the TRIP.COM site issue was answered with ""this is not refundable flight"", ""please, wait for 24-48-72 hours"" and other non relevant responses.1. We request the TRIP.COM to keep the officially made and recorded claim about the refund return and refund size - not for the ""self non refundable ticket purchase and personal decision to change flight dates later"" but the TRIP.COM site issue which caused that wrong date mess and the fake of ""Change/Cancel"" site feature which covered additional purchase and not the real change2. From personal side we definitely claim, that it was the first and the last experience with TRIP.COM as this whole ""business"" looks to be a huge machine of collecting consumers' money by any cost without any care about own concrete technical mistakes, zero responsibility for own official claims (even recorded) and without any idea about ""reputation"". This is not about ""foreign mentality"", which was mentioned by complainers here - we all know about the highest quality of AliBaba and AliExpress customer services. This is about this concrete and specific TRIP.COM ""business"", which looks to stand with one leg in the illegal area of fake, deceit and theft.Update:There is no option to respond to the TRIP.COM representatives answer here so I had to update the original post.Amber (if it's your real name) - please, don't lie.No one contacted me or my wife directly.No one.My phone - +972-54-5511020 (listed in the purchase)My wife's phone - +972-50-6720944 (listed in the purchase / TRIP.COM account we had to open).(e-mails are not allowed in reviews as it cleared out - but guys, you have ALL our e-mail addresses :) You can find them by our personal names in the e-mails you've received during the last 2 weeks.Again. No one contacted / tried to contact us - as sending mails with ""please, wait another 72 hours"" (from ""Vanessa"") or ""this is not re-chargeble flight"" mail from ""Darr"" is not ""contacting the person"".We were in contact with your representative by phone, phone conversation (which was recorded), where it was told that the ""flight is canceled and the redung of X sum will be returned in 5 business days"".All the rest ""we are sorry for inconvenience"" and ""we fully understand your prostration"" - all those key words and phrases, please, leave for the newcomers trainings.Please, fulfill your official claim and proceed with the re-fund. Your company has ALL the information required (including personal details), your company has all the booking and other wrong flight description details, your company has the reference to the recorded audio. Stop ping-ponging, start working.Good luck.Date of experience: 18 August 2022","1"
"3349","Thieving ScumTo call my booking experience appalling is putting it lightly. Now, we already understand the difficulty of refunds and whatnot which is why we purchased the additional £50 cancellation guarantee. Our flight was from Chiang Mai -> Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam with a connection in Bangkok and we spent £262. Everything was fine until they changed the first flight to make it impossible (20 minute connection time) to make the connection in Bangkok, meaning that we had to alter our first flight to ensure we could get the connection. This apparently was an impossibility so we decided to use our cancellation guarantee so we can book entirely new flights. Sadly, it wasn't a cancellation guarantee at all, it was a ""trip.com can steal all your money guarantee"". The refund took over 15 days to come through and out of the £262, we recieve a measly £5.60 - not even enough for a pint in some London pubs. Ah but don't fret! The rest was in airline vouchers - all £26 of it. This means that, out of £262 we paid, we received £31.60 in ""refund"" - didn't even cover the cancellation guarantee we forked out to ensure this would not happen. Trip.com and everything related is an absolute joke and I urge anyone who is planning to book through them to run AS FAR AS YOU CAN from these thieving robbing b@stards. I've never been robbed before, and don't think I want to be robbed again, hence why I will never book with trip.com. Disgusted is an understatement.Date of experience: 18 August 2022","1"

The system only ask for name/email/Handphone but not passport number when I booked if I’m not wrong. After using chat pot issue settle. But the lady keep asking passport photo which I think is unnecessary since only passport number is needed. And she told me if I don’t update the with passport using photo, then may not be able to board the flight. I check with airline after that, as per airline,  there is no issue to use old passport to book ticket as long as valid passport needed when boarding.Think it’s quite a lot of misunderstanding.When doing booking, if passport needed, may the system show and request to verify.

"3371","A nightmare to get a refund. Good at writing emails but terrible in giving refundsLast Sunday, August 7th I went to Beijing T3 to board my flight from Beijing to Guanzhou with Air China CA1351 which was due to leave at 8.00 am. I reached the Airport at 7.00 am. Now on my ticket, it's said that I have to be at the airport 45 minutes before departure.I am first directed to Gate J with automated check-in machines. I scan my passport twice and it doesn't work. So I am directed to Gate K for manual check-in. I join the queue and in front of me are three elderly people. They take their time and my turn arrives. As soon as I hand over my passport and the staff member says that my flight is cancelled. I say that I didn't receive any notification like that on my trip.com app and show her my ticket on my phone. She then says that the gates are closed and can't let me in, Now I must mention I am a foreigner and dark-skinned because this is quite important. I immediately asks for a supervisor, because there was 1. No final call is announced 2. There was no notification on the displays saying the gates were closed.The rude staff member asks me to walk across the airport to another gate to see a supervisor, to which I refuse and demands a supervisor there. Then another member arrives, and she gives the same answer. I stand my ground and keep demanding a supervisor...then after a few minutes, another staff member arrives from BEHIND at the check-in counter and says she's a supervisor and asks me to follow her. She keeps me waiting behind a line and then goes and processed to watch a computer screen. I keep waiting and I just go to her asking what's going on. And she comes and tells me that I arrived at the airport at this time and came to the check-in counter at this time and so on...so to save face she was watching the CCTV rather than actually coming up with a solution to get me on that plane.At this time it's already 7.38. So I immediately cancel my ticket through the app and place a call to the trip.com helpline to confirm it. And what's the worst part is, the flight actually took off at 8.25 am. A whole 25 minutes late! While those people were wasting time I could have boarded it. I asked for a refund on Sunday night, now it's Friday. I have received about 8 emails from 8 different people apologizing and telling me to ask for a refund from Air China! Why? I bought the ticket from Trip.Com. I cancelled through them. I am not in the wrong. It's due to their unprofessional ground staff that I was not allowed to get on that plane while everyone else was. Furthermore, I asked for a confirmation of refusal to board, and they pretended that they don't understand that.Trip.com is a nightmare to deal with. I would advise people, especially ex-pats in China, to avoid this app. They don't care about their clients.EditTrip.com sold me the tickets, they are the ones who have the right to cancel tickets. I didn't deal with the airline company. So why is trip.com trying to wash its hands by asking me to contact Air China? When I have clearly stated the whole incident with evidence. This shows how incompetent and nonchalant trip.com is about their clients.Update 29th November, 2023. trip.com has not helped me in resolving this matter. Truly unprofessional. Their reply below is false.Date of experience: 12 August 2022","1"

"3373","Worked fine with a few hiccups - Flights OnlyReview is regarding flightsI was hesitant to book flights due to the mix reviews.  But I went ahead since it was $300 cheaper for a RT flight to Mexico from CA (I booked it only 2 months in advance). Once I booked the flights, I received my Confirmation Number within 24 hours.  Because of the reviews, I was paranoid and checked my confirmation numbers on the airline website to make sure it existed every few weeks up until my trip. Good thing I did that because 2 weeks before my trip, my confirmation disappeared from the airlines. I immediately contacted Trip.com, they were quick and responsive and said they are working on it.  I then proceed to contact my airlines to double check. They said that my tickets were paid in Dubai dollars instead of USD, and that when I arrive at the airport, I would need to show them my credit card that I used or pay in cash.  Obviously the credit card I used was through trip.com, and trip.com used their own accounts to book it through the airlines- so a bit of a pickle here.  However, within 24 hours, I got my new confirmation numbers from trip.com and I verified it through my airlines and it was sorted out.  I have trust issues by now so I continued to check my confirmation number on the airlines website often.  It ended up working out, my trip was smooth. Overall, I saved $300+ and spent maybe 2 hours at the most trying to sort things out.  I believe this is a company from Singapore, and not China.  And I agree with the other reviews, make sure you do not need to change anything otherwise it would be an even larger headache. I normally book my flights 6+ months in advance and I would book through the actual airlines directly to avoid a third party.  However, for this particular trip, I booked somewhat last minute (2 months in advance) and the costs have skyrocketed.  So since it saved me a lot of money, I went ahead and booked it and it worked out with a few hiccups.  Just do your due diligence and check with the airlines directly to make sure everything is sorted out.Date of experience: 11 August 2022","4"

"3377","STILL NO REFUNDThe worst travel experience ever – I will never book with Trip.com again even if you paid me! This is beyond frustrating and I did not want to write an angry essay to hopefully get the help I am after. This is a disgraceful waste of my time. I was in Munich when my flights were cancelled so I booked the only flights back that were available via Majorca – hardly convenient. On the day of the flight, I was told that they may not be space on the transfer flight to London. Whilst I was flying in the air I had a series of voicemails asking me to contact Trip.com as there was no room on the flight. I spoke to several advertisers that told me different things – I called maybe 6 times. I was told that Trip.com would sort out the flights and the night's accommodation – this was a lie and I ended up paying for extra flights and accommodation. After three weeks of this maltreatment and several more wasted phone calls, I am still waiting for a refund. I have been told that the money is in my account – which it is not. I now have wasted I further 40 mins on the phone to HSBC about this and told that there are no pending payments. I have an email saying I was paid on the 27th this a part refund for my accommodation! STILL WAITING FOR MY FLIGHT REFUND. CALLED TWICE MORE SINCE POSTING THIS - WAS TOLD A MANAGER WOULD CALL THEY NEVER DID. I CALLED TWICE MORE TODAY - TOLD THE SAME THING THAT THEY ARE LOOKING INTO THIS WITH THE RELEVANT TEAM AND THEY WILL UPDATE - 4 WEEKS SINCE MY CANCELLED FLIGHT AND I HAVE CALLED DAILY SINCE THURSDAY. THANKS RACHEL - I AM CONFUSED ABOUT WHY THIS IS SO COMPLEX AND WHY NO ONE HAS STILL CONTACTED ME. YOU MANAGED TO TRANSFER ME 161 JULY 27 - WHY IS THIS IS SO COMPLICATED - ANOTHER DAY HAS PASSED WITH NO UPDATE.

I eventually found a good option about 4 days later than what I originally wanted so that is OK because the price was acceptable.The customer service agent was nice to speak to but interesting to be informed that the agents cannot process purchases for the reason of credit card safety...which I suppose is a good thing.In summary, I did accomplish making a good flight booking but the process did take time as was a little frustrating that an option shows 5 seats left but then literally seconds later it is not available.Date of experience: 04 August 2022","4"

I found myself going back and forth between trip.com and the airline (Qantas), which was very frustrating. However, I do want to particularly thank Kenzie who went out of their way to find a reasonable solution for me.

"3419","Trip.com was okay, Holiday inn, not so muchTrip.com was okay. The Hotel, not so much. Typical Holiday Inn but the building was old. HVAC is lacking. Very damp and musty in the room the whole time. We hung towels where we could but they wouldn't dry even after 24 hours! No ventilation in the rooms we could see. The ac kept us cool but it had a musty smell the whole stay. The bathroom ceiling has water damage undoubtedly from the lack of ventilation in the system Needs a dehumidifier. The floor had rust spots by the tub and the bathroom door stainless steel door hinges were rusted If we had time we would have searched further and paid more if we had to. Lobby was fine, staff very attentive. Breakfast provided was ok, powdered eggs, no bacon but turkey sausage and gravy/biscuits looked unappealing, but the other normal continental Bfast items were available. Ultimately, We always ask each other this question as the ultimate review: would you go back? I would have to say No.Date of experience: 27 July 2022","3"

Trip.com sent an automated notification. I rang them to cancel the reservation and an agent named Fazer, raised the issue with the supervisor and they agreed to cancel and give a full refund. Only, the latter never happened. Since then about a dozen of different staff would sent me dribble about sending request for a refund, blaming KLM airline, asking me to speak to the airline, effectively abandoning any responsibility. The experience with the staff on the phone is horrendous to say the least. Each time I call, they put me on hold for 20-30 minutes to review the notes on the matter, then they promise that ‘a relevant department will respond with an email about your case’. No resolution, no refunds, blaming the airline, asking me to speak to the airline, the airline will not take any instructions from me as the booking was made by the agency (trip.com). Just to give you a taste, here’s an email I got yesterday at 02:59 GMT (so you know the staff at trip.com work somewhere in Asia)Dear *** For your flight booking from Gothenburg to Dublin, (booking no. 18***, passenger names: ***/***),as we carefully checked with the airline, you must submit your refund request before departure.Thanks for choosing Trip.com.

"3445","You are the worst platform to buy…You are the worst platform to buy airline tickets and I am spreading the world to tell my experience to everyone. You cheat customers like me who trusted you and bought online tickets from Jordan to Hong Kong.The first leg was ""self transfer"", was fine to me as I did not know what it meant. Not until I found out my 2nd leg was not issued and it wasn't going to be issued until a few days before the trip... which would be too late as your agent said there is risk I won't get the ticket issued. When I said, ok, I will cancel the whole ticket so I can buy something else to get to HK, your agent told me the partially issued ticket is non refundable. I have never ever, nor my family, nor my friends have ever heard of this clever cheating ""option"" to lure customers to buy tickets and then issue one leg and not the other... who wants to buy tickets that way??  You are very tricky people to even come up with this idea.  Lucky you, you earned some commission from the first leg.  I was initially wondering how come you'd show availability from Jordan to HK, as every other site, Kiwi, Wing On, google travel and Emirates all showed economy was full. I thought you were something special when you showed you had available seats... to my surprise, you did have NO SEATS but you charged me as if you had.Hong Kong have manadatory quarantine hotels and many travel restrictions, I had to fly on that date to get to the quarantine hotel reservation. In this day and age, there is no business or purpose for partially issued tickets. who would have such an idea - only your amazing crooked company and team.

Our flight from UK to Antalya was cancelled by the airline therefore you’d think a reschedule would be made but my god no, after contacting CS to put through a change request of the flight the request would go through to someone called the handler which would then inevitably change your flight, they’ll contact you via email and tell you your change request is being processed and if it’s a free change they’ll change it automatically if not they’ll contact you to verify( all makes sense at the mo) then a few hours later I’ll get a random email saying request has no charge and send us verification email to make the change then literally and when I say Literally another email 1min later cancelling the request with no reason whatsoever. This has happened to me altogether 6 times and still my return flight has not been resolved. Explaining this to CS is a nightmare because everyone would give random excuses for the issue and all they can do is submit another request with different times which inevitably gets cancelled apparently there is no contact number for the people called the handlers nor can the CS contact them to find out what’s going on just save yourself the headache.

No prior notice received and still yet to be received from trip.com that the flight had been cancelled.

"3479","Avoid this website. My credit card used by an international bank to make a reservation in the USI would avoid this website.  When I made a reservation in the US, my card was charged by a bank in Hong Kong.  I was looking for a hotel room on TripAdvisor.com, but somehow accidentally found my way to Trip.com without realizing it.  I made a reservation for a hotel in NY from my home (also in the US), and my husband was able to check in to the hotel.  However, we noticed a credit card alert saying a bank in Hong Kong had used my credit card, apparently to make the reservation.  I was surprised that my card number and info were used in an international transaction.  I felt deceived because I didn’t intend to use Trip.com as it is not a site I am familiar with.  I also felt alarmed when I saw my card being used in an international transaction.  After calling our bank to learn what had happened, we were very upset, and decided to use another bank card to pay for the hotel.  So far, no other suspicious charges have been made but we are concerned we are at risk.  Also, after using this site, I received unwanted emails from Trip.com asking me to download their app to get reward coins (??…) as well as other emails (could be a coincidence, hard to say, but it seems like a lot of strange shady emails in one week) after using this site.  I suspect they do not protect customer data very well, and maybe use it for profit.  As my first and only experience with this company gave me a lot of sketchy vibes (wanted tripadvisor.com but somehow got trip.com…my card was used by an international bank when I attempted to make a reservation at a US hotel…unwanted email suggesting I download their app to get some kind of points or coins on my next purchase…other scam/phishing emails received since using this site), I recommend avoiding this site altogether and paying careful attention where you make a reservation even when you are attempting to use a well known site.  I unsubscribed from the emails and blocked the company.  Hoping I never hear from them again but I will be keeping an eye out for further suspicious charges and emails.Date of experience: 30 June 2022","1"

"3491","Avoid avoid avoid dealing with Trip.comI booked two round-trip tickets to visit my family in Kurdistan through Trip.com.  London Gatwick - Istanbul, Istanbul-Sulaymaniyah.  When we tried to check-in we were told our flights are not connected and I had to pay £142 for my flights to be connected.  To our unfortunate luck, our flight to Istanbul was delayed due to extreme weather conditions in Istanbul. So we missed our connecting flights.  Once again we were told our flights are not connected in Istanbul and we had to pay £895 for two return tickets to Sulaymaniyah.  Plus we had to stay in a hotel as our flight was at midnight.  Trip.com doesn't want to know the stress and emotional strain we experienced as a result of their action by not connecting our flights.  Please avoid this site do not ever purchase any flight tickets, they scam you by offering a cheap ticket but you will end up paying twice as much.  For your information, this company is based in China, and not easy to sue them or try to get a refund.  Please please get away from this site and never book anything with them.Date of experience: 22 June 2022","1"

The internet voice calls are always dropped, there is no follow-through when you email them or call them (even when you give a very clear summary of the situation), the customer service representatives constantly repeat their script, rather than providing actually helpful feedback. I really tried to change it, but in the end, it was clear Trip.com did not want to help me, despite my stressful situation. I've never encountered worst customer service.

I only find out in TA office, they cancelled all flights to the destination for the whole months, so the only option was a refund. So a lot of useless discussions with Trip.com, lost time with no effect. We got the refund eventually, but no any compensation for additional costs when purchasing new airline tickets by ourselves. At begining they offered us 150 USD as a gesture of goodwill which we have never received (additional cost were approx 600 eur). After the refund from TA they stoped responding.

"3527","Incredibly poor serviceMy flight changed departure origin and I was notified by the airline and trip.com I was completely eligible for a refund. We followed all of the procedures about applying for this refund with both parties (airline and trip.com).After 5 separate refund requests, probably 10+ calls with trip.com I still don’t have any hope of a refund. I ring the airline and am told that it’s completely refundable, collected all of the ref numbers etc and trip.com will will email me saying I am not eligible when Fiji airways has made it abundantly clear it’s refundable.At this point trip.com promises they will contact me within a few hours after every call and that has been honoured once - I have to chase if I ever want a proper update.I also keep being told my process will be expedited after the last 3 customer service people have mentioned this - it’s confusing and concerning. Is this even being expedited? Or is this something you just say to get the customer off the phone.There is also no escalation process with anyone other than the local supervisor, who will repeat back whatever you have heard from the customer service agent - you can’t escalate further, ask for any kind of record of emails they have exchanged with the vendor, have a copy of the recording (of your own voice for that matter) or any kind of detail about your case. They will say they request these details and then never respond to you.At this point I just want my money back - I’m not asking for anything other than what I’m entitled to as stated by the airline. It feels at this point that trip.com wants to keep my money and will wear me down until I give up. This is £600+ worth of refund for a flight I did not take and was offered an immediate refund for. The process really shouldn’t be this painful as it is a colossal waste of my time and trip.com (including the cost of making your service team take these calls and reopen the case each time I apply). At this point they’re witholding my money from me. I will never use trip.con again as I don’t ever want to risk having to do this process again. I highly recommend just booking directly with the airline for a better process and service.Update to Trip.com response below:All that is offered to me is sincere apologies - that becomes extremely redundant after the amount of hassle I have gone through and the amount of times this has been said to me. This is not a complaint you have just learned of either, I already have an ongoing complaint that has been open for a week.A proper resolution would be to refund me and recoup the costs from the airline yourselves as the airline has already told me many times this is refundable. This all could be avoided if trip.com rang the main line and input the details I collected for you since you were unable to do this yourself. I don’t accept the apology because there has been little to no action to show any form of remorse to the situation. These are empty words without action.Date of experience: 07 June 2022","1"

He worked around the no refund policy at Trip.com and got me a refund within an hour. The only reason I gave a four star instead of a five star review is that very no refund policy. But that's not Nick Hou's call. If I could I'd give Nick a 10-star review I would. In fact I'd hire him if I had a customer relations position.Date of experience: 23 May 2022","4"

I had become anxious and alarmed at the aggression used so had opted to leave without taking the vehicle. I had contacted Trip.com immediately asking for a refund as a breach to a legal contract made between myself and trip.com had been violated the moment I was made to upgrade my vehicle. Trip.com refused to take responsibility for this and have been met with excuses such as a (no-show) insinuating that I did not arrive to collect the car. when I had provided video evidence and and geographical evidence of me at the rental company they had then offered me £20 back from a £171.75 booking and said and I qoute""Nevertheless, 20 GBP is the best offer we could give after consideration as we are not keep you money in our company""Absolute scam of a company who had breached a legal contract and broken the consumer protection regulation 2008 when aggressive commercial practices had been portrayed.Date of experience: 23 May 2022","1"

According to EU regulation (EC) No 261/2004 I'm entitled to a compensation. Trip.com made no efforts to help me claim the compensation and asked my to deal with it myself. The airline doesn't allow me claim for the compensation since I'm not the booking owner and I don't have an account associated with the booking. In this case, trip.com is the booking owner and should help me get the compensation I deserve. I had to wait for 8 hours at the airport to be notified that the flight was cancelled and had to book a £300 flight on the next day myself. I totally deserve a compensation. I suggest everyone never ever book through travel agency, especially trip.com, because when there is an issue, they don't care about customer rights and won't help you to get what you are entitled while they are the only entity to apply for it.AND stop copying and pasting the same insincere reply here, nothing is changed, my issue is still unresolved!Date of experience: 17 May 2022","1"

This is not compansation for their wrong doing and only complys with their policy of a guarentee of refund re booking of tickets.The situation has literally left me a complete mess and the holiday was a shambles due to having to rearrange dates for flights, accomodation, child care with their father and to top it off we missed the good weather, which I know is changeable but I had been watching and had we gone when origionally planned would have been great!Just a note to future users of this site though, read and be clear of the small print regarding the cancelation and rebooking of tickets. I booked and paid for 3 return tickets to Faro 14 days ago. 5 days ago I checked my emails for the tickets.They had not been issued.I called and emailed.  Each time I was told to wait and they would sort it out.I called once on the Friday 8th AprilI called twice on Saturday 9th April.  Each time being told everything was fine.  I was told on saturday someone would call me back in 2 hrs.  They did not hence my further call at 11pmBy Sunday 7am no one had called again and still no tickets.I spoke to 3 people that morning. Each time being put on hold to speak to managers. Tara was very helpful but sadly she is not on shift anymore.I had an email from both Kenzie and Nori the managers telling me they would personally solve this for me OR replace my tickets with new tickets.Sunday night came no more emails or phone calls.Monday morning, no tickets.  Another phone call from me to them to ask what was happening.Again told I would be rung back.Now I have recieved a basic email from an advisor saying to cancell my tickets! No offer as the website says that they will secure replacement tickets for me.So, another phone call 35 mins on hold, where Garbiella tried to help me.  She has had to request a refund for me and now I have to book my own new tickets and they are saying they will reimburse me.   But I hold no hope!I am so stressed and upset.  3 yrs i have been saving for this trip for the boys.Date of experience: 11 April 2022","1"

"3708","I booked a return flight with themI booked a return flight with them, I ended up missing my first flight because of an expired covid test (my fault) but because I knew I would miss my flight a few hours before I tried calling them and spoke to loads of different agents to ask if the could help with booking me a new flight or maybe cancelling and refunding my tickets. Every time I spoke to them they said they would make the request and email back, so I was always in limbo about what was happening. Eventually they were able to do nothing and so I accepted that I had to by a new outbound ticket and would never get mine cancelled or any kind of refund which was fine. But they never told me once, on any of the many calls, that missing my outbound flight would make my return flight invalid. So 2 weeks later I go to the airport thinking I still have a return ticket to use and then get told I cannot get on the flight and to phone Trip.com and get them to issue me a new ticket as this one is now invalid. Again after many calls and requests that seem to take forever, I ended up missing that flight and having to purchase  a new ticket (which trip.com told me on the phone to do and told me to keep the receipt as they would refund me! oh and they never did), so I basically bought two single tickets for double the price of my original return ticket which sucked. Unfortunately I will not be using them again.Date of experience: 04 April 2022","1"

The first time I contacted them was more than 2 weeks before the flight date and they confirmed my situation was eligible for a full refund. After providing all the required information and contacting them several times, they told me that my only option was to request an open ticket and that they were unable to apply for it since the change has to be made 3 weeks before the original date, which is something no one mentioned during all the calls we had. Of course, after this the only thing they could say was that this was a non-refundable flight and that I should reach out to the airline, so unacceptable...The delays in their answers and the lack of clarity have led me to be in a very frustrating situation.I will never use Trip.com again.

"3759","Most stressful company to deal with everI have had the most painful, frustrating, time consuming, stress inducing experience trying to communicate with Trip.com. my first time booking through them. Their customer service leaves a lot to be desired. A thread of emails has been going back and forth between us for 2 weeks now with no resolution. I received change flight emails at 2.30 / 3.30 am twice now with just one hour to accept changes and at crazy prices (1,600). Am I to wait up all night on emails from Trip.com, it appears so.  No consistency in terms of advice from the different customer service workers that have responded to me. I have requested multiple times for a senior customer service manager to call me to try resolve the matter only to receive what appears to be a generic, copy and paste response advising me to ring them. I have been given the run around of all run arounds ( think wild goose chase) by this company as have 2 of my friends in the last fortnight. The package we bought and paid for in full with Trip.com is no longer the package we are receiving. Flight times has changed of one of the flights meaning the connecting flight does not work. I have out forward a very low cost solution ( alternative flights available online with the airline at less than €40 and they do not seem to be able to get their heads around the request / accommodating the resolution. They have been absolutely no help. I would not recommend booking through Trip.com. App easy to use but once your money has been received they do not seem to care after that.Date of experience: 13 March 2022","1"
"3760","Absolutely dreadfulAbsolutely dreadful. No links to online check, doesnt even say which airline it is with. called support and was told to check itinerary, nothing on there that links to check in, or which airline it is. Ended up paying 50 euros for in person check in. I would advise people not to use this company. I received nothing from Ryanair to even acknowledge the booking. UPDATE:After multiple emails, I have established that the only time there is mention of who the flight was booked with, is on the flight payment page, along with the jumble of pop-ups, car hire, insurance, hotel bookings etc. There is no further mention of this in the itinerary, booking confirmation etc. I still hold the view that this is appalling.

I attempted to book flights with skyscanner who transfer you to Trip.com, after three failed attempts to purchase tickets and two calls to Trip.com customer service team who said the reason the purchases had failed was due to lack of funds in my bank account which I can assure you was NOT the case!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Craig the customer service advisor was clueless as to why my transactions had failed and just talked over me all the time that I was speaking and insisted that it was my problem not Skyscanner or Trip,com.  I contacted my bank who said that they have no transaction information from Trip.com, my bank then transferred me to their fraud department who said they can see that the money had been attempted to be collected and authorised but blocked at the verification process by the seller.  if this has happened to me three times how many other people has this happened to!

"3784","No Benefit to book your flight through…Do not book your flight through trip.com and instead book directly with the airline, trip.com has a very bad arrangement with airlines. I had booked a non-refundable but changeable ticket London-Montreal for January 2022 but due to an Omicron surge in Montreal had to cancel and change the date. That was no problem, I paid the £90 fee and I could change it to August. However, the price for the August ticket was ca. £500 less than the January ticket . Under the trip.com contract with the airline, this money is kept by the airline and lost to you but if you book directly, you will have more flexibility, the airline will make more of an effort and will at least give you a voucher. Furthermore, the January ticket price with trip.com was actually more expensive than the same ticket with Lufthansa!! Unfortunately I discovered that only after booking.

I get same excuses, they never call back when they say they will and have an attitude that they can't help and the computer says no.I would be embarrassed to provide such poor service.

After checking the platform, I could only see my birthdate and the ID number of my passport, but couldn't access any additional information. So I decided to call and get some feedback from the Trip.com Call Center for Germany. The waiting time was surprisingly short, something which truly pleased me. The agent was incredibly friendly and prone to help me after I had explained my situation, and was very voluntary to check all the necessary information about the automatic check-in. Apart from solving the issue (which in fact didn't even exist, I'm generally anxious and panic easily) and informing me about everything related to the check-in, I was also pleased by a fantastic conversation with the agent.

"3815","Trip.com mis-sells Ryanair flights via Dublin on SkyScanner.netOn 28 November I bought a round trip from Edinburgh to Frankfurt via Dublin, flying out on 2 December and back on 7 December 2021. I found the trip on SkyScanner. It was sold by Trip.com (booking no. 16897422120) and all flights were provided by Ryanair (flights FR381 and FR383 out; FR381, FR816 return). The connection time at Dublin was 55 minutes. There was a warning that this is short but, at the time of booking, 55 minutes appear to me adequate to arrive at one gate and leave from an adjacent gate with the same airline. The sellers failed to take into account, and I did not know until I got there, that transit at Dublin is not allowed! Trip.com should know this and plan for flight connection at Dublin to take at least 90 minutes.On the outgoing trip I made the connection by the skin of my teeth, even though the incoming flight was slightly early. I had to sprint the length of Terminal 1, pass through customs and immigration, then turn around, come back through the security check, and sprint the full length of the terminal again. There were no delays at all, but the gate was closed when I arrived. Ryanair was kind enough to let me on anyway.I did not want to risk being stranded at Dublin on the way back, so I asked Trip.com to rebook that journey by another route. The answer was an email saying they hoped to help me within 72 hours, which was too long, so I rebooked the trip myself on Air France and EasyJet via Paris, giving myself 2 hours for the transit. That worked well. I should never have been offered the trip from Edinburgh to Frankfurt via Dublin as a viable route. This is mis-selling by Trip.com, so I hold them responsible. I have asked for a refund, in the sum of £63.80 for the unusable return flight, comprising half of the flight costs £27.40, plus £36.40 paid to Ryanair for cabin bags on the unused return leg. Trip.com has so far declined to accept responsibility, saying that Ryanair does not provide for cancellation. But I did not cancel willingly! I travelled that day but was obliged to take another route due to no fault on my part. The flight I booked to replace it cost about £200, so that would be suitable compensation. Had I known that a reasonable route would cost £400 both ways I would not have made the trip at all! Trip.com bought the four flights from Ryanair under separate booking numbers (out UFUQJX, G68S7S; return R9VTTM, E5J5UI) so it is understandable that Ryanair does not feel responsible for (or even knew about) the connection. However, Ryanair could do more to make purchasers aware that connection in Dublin is not possible in under 90 minutes and spot separate bookings that appear to imply a connection (same customer flying out shortly after arrival). SkyScanner regards Trip.com as a partner so does not take responsibility, but I think they might do more to vet partners’ offerings and terminate the partnership in cases of mis-selling through SkyScanner.Remedy suggested: Apology, refund, and compensation in the sum of £200.Date of experience: 13 December 2021","1"

"3818","Useless, incompetent and lazy travel agencyWorst trip I have ever experienced. They got my first and last names wrong, and when I requested to change it they force to wait three days and decided to send an email in early morning where I have to pay WITHIN 30 MINUTES, I wasn't even awake by then. They cancelled the name change right after, and when I tried to change it again they found out my return flight seat GOT CANCELLED. It's been a week and all they have done is tried to call the airline ONCE and emailed them ONCE, my flight is LITERALLY tomorrow. Absolute joke of a company, useless, incompetent and lazy team of people.Edit: So after this reply down here, nothing.

"3822","Thieves!!!! Avoid this booking site like a plagueTrip.Com I’ve just received an email from you guys saying my flight has changed again and that I should contact you before 25 Dec to request a refund. I would like a refund for this trip because it’s clearly not working out. I’ve received numerous flight change emails and I’ve now had enough, so could you guys please process my refund!!!! ***UPDATE*** I received a call from a polite customer service manager who wanted to assist in rectifying the situation and tried the best she could. Unfortunately she was not able to book me back in on the original dates I PAID FOR, which was the 25th Dec to the 29th Dec, so I was left with no choice but to settle for the 27th to 30th of Dec which is not convenient for me, but I found it the better option rather than possibly losing all my money or potentially being offered a voucher rather than a refund which is a big NO for me given my experience so far. ***They’ve replied and said they will be in touch directly with me. I’m still waiting and will give an update on weather or not we came to a suitable resolution!***Avoid this booking site like a plague. I booked a ticket for evening of 25th Dec to return 29th December. They confirmed everything and took my money. Then yesterday they send me an email to say my departure flight is changed to the 27th, I arrive late night on 27th, and leave early morning 29th. So I literally have only 1 day at the destination. That is totally not practical and makes no sense whatsoever. I cannot change my travel dates, and I requested a refund as these are not the dates I booked to travel. They have told me they cannot give me a refund. Absolute bullsh**t! I had my reservations about using this silly trip.com n the first place, I only wish I had followed my instincts.

How that happened I didn't understand. I was forced to book another ticket since the initial train had departed! I was so vexed. I called Trip.com and was served by very understanding staff like Christy and Lana; and a gentleman I can't remember the name.Eventually my case was sorted out despite having been inconvenienced through loss of valuable travel time. A refund was made and to appreciate my patience, trip.com even opted to send me a token equal to the initial fare plus refund for the refund handling fee and extra fare paid over and above the initial fare.

In May 2021 I made a purchase at the Iberostar Bahia hotel for 3 nights with my husband and 6-year-old son, on this website, and paid via this TRIP.com. When booking, I chose a room that was suitable for a 6-year-old child, but upon booking, the website did not give me the option to write the names of the guests. I read and reread the hotel's policy on child accommodation and saw that everything was fine, as my child is under 6 years old, and doesn't need an extra bed, so I didn't need to name it.When I shop online, for travel, I always check with the hotel before boarding, so as not to have surprises, if the reservation is OK. To my surprise, the hotel said that I would have to pay extra for the child, that my child was not included in the booking.I contacted TRIP.com, who after 48 hours of insisting, gave me the following answer: They can't do anything, because the hotel is full, and that in fact, I will have to pay extra for the child.I paid a promotional price with a child and now they are doing this nonsense.

When I was looking over the tickets yesterday (Sunday morning July 18 2021) I realized that they were reversed in travel. So I called within 24 hours to change the departure and arrive. They said they could contact the airlines and see if they would let them do that and also said there might be an extra amount I would have to pay I was ok with that at first cus I looked on the frontiers website on the same flight and it should have only cost me an extra $60 along with what I have already paid and I was willing to pay that. A couple of hours later they called me back and said the airline would let me do it but for an extra 150. I told them that is double what the airline would have charged me had I gone straight thru them instead of y'all and I told them to just issue me a refund. I was told I would receive the full amount for the flights and they said they could not issue a refund on baggage. I was fine with that because I was expecting a full refund for the flight. I got a message this morning and I'm only being refunded $11.00. What is wrong with companies that don't care about their consumers I did everything within a 24 period and tried to change the departure and arrive instead of getting a refund, but y'all wanted to double the price and I couldn't afford that. We as consumers go on your sites to find better deals not to be ripped off.  Now, I don't have the money to go see my kids thanks Trip.com for ruining my visit with my kids and grandkids.

"3878","Great customer serviceAfter our unfortunate experience of a delayed flight which resulted in the next connecting flight leaving us behind, I was thrilled by the prompt phone call responses and urgency attached to our situation from trip.com service providers. Prior to contacting trip.com, many phone calls were made to the first air line's customer service providers that delayed our flight but all attempts were futile. In fact we were really devastated because we really wanted to reunite with our respective families after three years of not seeing each other. After taking a detailed report from us (meanwhile my junior brother who purchased the ticket was also making background calls to trip.com agents), trip.com was able to contact the next flight that left us behind and within a matter of 24 hours, our money (major part) was refunded to us. At last we had a rejuvenated hope to purchase a new ticket for the next available flight. I remember the name of Lynn and according to my brother, he first contacted another wonderful and helpful guy whose name I can not recollect. I will not hesitate to contact trip.com in future on any flight related service.Date of experience: 18 July 2021","5"

"3880","No entry into the hotelHello I had booked a room in the Niranta transit hotel mumbai airport terminal 2 for my friend for the night of 17th July 2021.However upon arrival we were denied service/entry as the hotel staff said the hotel can only be used by passengers travelling via the mumbai airport. This is not mentioned anywhere in the booking confirmation. I had also called the hotel while booking to check if they had such rules? Unfortunately my calls went unanswered.As a result we had to book a separate hotel last minute for an expensive price.This is completely unacceptable and I would like a refund please.Edit: even though the hotel refused the refund, Trip.com team were kind enough to give me trip coins as the refund amount! 5 stars!Date of experience: 17 July 2021","5"

I tried cancelling a hotel booking after only a day and all they can say is let me see what I can. This took at least 3 days of back and forth and finally they said Nope, I cannot cancel without even giving me a valid reason why. I am now forced to contact my credit card company in hopes to get my refund back as Trip.com is now trying to force me to stay with the booking because I paid in advanced. The service has not rendered yet and they still forced me to prepay to keep the booking in which they do not wish to help me cancel.

I lost £206 as my stay would have been last year during covid situation (only essential travels were allowed, so obviously i could not make the trip). I was offered an extnesion until the end of this year, but as i realised i will not be able to use it. I tried to get a refund instead as ( closing borders, hotels etc. is out of my fault) Obviously i could not get anywhere with my request. all i was told multiple times that i can make a new booking, it is extended until the end of the year.I think it shows really well how much they care about their customers and how much they care about money...just avoid them...Date of experience: 04 June 2021","1"

"3904","Very nice and unusual surprise!I booked a flight for 2 pax through Trip.com earlier this month. Everything seemed fine, except that I made the not so smart mistake to insert the wrong date (month). Since it was a promo fare, I was worried that I would loose the money because of a dumb mistake. Luckily, I saw the mistake in a matter of hours and contacted Trip.com through their channels. Honestly, I wasn't very hopeful at all that I would get a flight reschedule or a refund. And so, I was informed just that. However, to my surprise, I was also informed that they would refund the ticket themselves! (maybe because they saw as an honest mistake?) That was beyond nice..... I went through some email exchanges and app chat. All attendants were very courteous and replies were timely. Took the courage to book new flights, making extra sure of the dates. Went great, finally. To put the cherry on top of the cake, I've got the refund of the wrong ones on my credit card.

Took them 10 seconds to take our payment of $1,100 and then they emailed within 5 minutes saying our booking could not complete and they would refund us within 10 days. OMG it gets worse. After they sent the cancellation email I went and booked direct with the airline for about the same and then 10 minutes later Trip.com email me saying 'Booking confirmed'! I call their customer services and they guy says 'Oh you must have booked twice'! He then told me to contact the airline directly and see if they will cancel their flight and refund me (which they did thank fully even though it was no fault of theirs). I then had to phone Trip.com back up and at least the guy i got this time was helpful although he just needed to assure me they hadn't cancelled this trip on the back of my previous call.

"3931","Charged phantom fee, refund problemsI booked a trip Helsinki-Zhengzhou with JUNEYAO AIR via Trip.com in October. A few days before my trip (in November), China changed the rules of travel because of COVID-19, and I needed to change the departure date. Juneyao Airlines published on their website that because of this they are waiving their change date fee. However, when I asked Trip about this, they claimed 3 times (over email correspondence) that I have to pay the 167 EUR fee. I paid. When in February I had to finally cancel my trip because of other reasons, Juneyao agreed to refund full ticket. To my surprise, Juneyao representatives claimed repeatedly that Trip.com never contacted them and that I never needed to pay the fee. Juneyao confirmed that they issued refund, but Trip.com representatives claimed that didn't happen. After 19 days of constant emails between both Trip and Juneyao, Juneyao changed their tune and said that I needed to pay the fee and that they will not refund (AFTER claiming that they already refunded and that TRIP charged phantom fee!). To complicate things more, I got an email from Trip claiming that they will refund the fee, only to change their opinion again 3 days later and say that they will not refund! Even if I actually needed to pay the fee after all, both companies should have made an exception and refund the fee because of their gross incompetence in handling this situation.I DEFINITELY ADVISE AGAINST BUYING VIA TRIP, OR FLYING WITH JUNEYAO AIRLINES. BOTH COMPANIES ARE EXTREMELY IRRESPONSIBLE AND DISRESPECTFUL TO THEIR CLIENTS!Date of experience: 24 February 2021","1"

Also received an email from a manager. Approximately a week after writing this review, I received a refund to my payment account for the original amount spent on the ticket. I have increased my rating from 1 star to 3 stars because they made things right. I would like to thank the employees at Trip.com for correcting this issue. Would I use them again in the future? I can't say yes or no at this time. I feel the issue was resolved quickly, but sadly I had to write a negative review on a public forum for this to be corrected. Take it as you will. Original Review: Our flight got cancelled in April because of the pandemic. Refund date kept on getting pushed forward. Last they said one full year from cancellation for resolution. How does that make sense? And now I can't even see my booking on the app. It just disappeared. I do not recommend using Trip com. They are the worst 3rd party company we have ever used. I will also be contacting the airline directly. I am suspicious that they have received the refund or voucher already.Date of experience: 15 December 2020","3"

"3962","Do not use trip.comDo not use trip.com. It is a scam service that wants your money and screws the travelers and airlines over. We have been seeking a refund since March 2020, almost 9 months of infuriating and unhelpful correspondence. We have gone back and forth with trip.com through over 20 emails and calls.Instead of taking accountability, we were directed repeatedly to the airlines. However, the airlines confirmed that trip.com sought a charge back of our reservations so they cannot be responsible for our refund. Avoid trip.com at all costs, no matter how good the deal appears.Date of experience: 03 November 2020","1"
"3963","Too bad there's no option for 0 starToo bad there's no option for 0 star. I've been trying to get a refund for my cancelled flight (cancelled by airline due to covid back in april). I've contacted trip.com multiple times and they only offered a change of dates valid only for 1 year, change the dates to what? since pandemic is still around and restrictions still apply in some countries i do not feel safe booking a flight in this hard times, 1 year is simple not enough. I've contacted the airline and they told me that since I booked thought trip.com its their decision to give me a refund, I've sent this info to trip.com customer service and since then there has been just silence. My next step is to file a complaint but please be aware that this company just takes your money even if they dont provide any service, they won't try to help you. Never again will book with them neither you should, please stay away.Date of experience: 02 November 2020","1"
"3964","London to Lisbon - tricked out of moneyI booked a return flight ticket from London to Lisbon today.  Trip.com took my money and confirmed the booking.  Four hours later they said they couldn't issue the outbound ticket.  They will only refund the outbound flight but say the inbound is confirmed and refuse to refund the other part of the ticket even though I can't get to Lisbon to fly back!  They also say this is their 'policy', it seems a dirty trick to keep customer's money -  I am out of pocket and extremely dissatisfied as they have it within their means to refund me the full amount owed.Date of experience: 02 November 2020","1"
"3965","Horrible, Horrible ServiceI made a reservation at this hotel through Trip.Com and was EXTREMELY disappointed upon arrival to find two other distressed customers in the lobby.  They were complaining that the computer system had double charged them, not a worry for me, I thought, because I booked online.  What turned me off was the clerk, behind the register, Mia, was tapping her nails on the desk, rolling her eyes at the customer, and doing nothing to assist the women ahead of me in line.  In addition to her lack of professionalism and obvious disinterest in being of service to the customer, she grabbed her cell phone while the customer was asking for help and stood behind the desk texting.  After waiting around while this scenario played out and observing the characters lounging around outside smoking cigarettes (not a single no smoking sign or designated smoking area to be found), I decided this hotel was absolutely not for me - not for my safety as a young woman traveling alone - nor do I ever, in any circumstance, support businesses monetarily whom treat their customers with such blatant disrespect.  I called their reservations line and the office was willing to issue a refund until they saw I booked through a third party site.  When I called Trip.Com to ask for a refund since I never checked in to the hotel and had booked on short notice because of a glitch in my original AirBnb plans, they gave me the run around for an hour and a half, told me they needed to contact the hotel before issuing the refund.  I gave my number to front desk clerk, Mia, to speak with the manager and have this issue resolved so that the Trip.Com representatives (who, by the way, offered me $20 for ""emotional distress"" instead of a full refund) could issue my refund.  The manager never called, the Trip.Com representatives emailed and said they could not refund me because ""the hotel said I checked in and stayed the full duration"", which was entirely untrue.  I had left the hotel and made other arrangements entirely after the original observation of the hotel's staff.  At this point, I have come to believe both the hotel and Trip.Com have absolutely no concern for their guests whatsoever.  From the original front desk clerk to the characters loitering about the motel, Trip.Com and the HomeTowne Studios have demonstrated absolutely no interest in providing a safe, secure, welcoming environment for guests and potential guests.  Do not book this place online - go see it first.  The companies will, in my experience, blatantly lie about you staying in this hotel in order to avoid issuing a refund.  Horrible, horrible experience with both companies.Date of experience: 02 November 2020","1"

"3967","Bad communication, misleading, not to be trustedIn the Covid context (the flight was going to be cancelled), I sent several emails to Trip.com in good faith to understand how I should proceed to get a full refund for my planned trip to Vienna (209€) ... I followed the poorly written instructions in bad English and (much) later discovered that all I got was an incomplete, albeit misleading picture on how to proceed to get my funds back. As a result, I will now receive a 59€ refund instead of the full 209€ which I was entitled to due to the pandemic. I was adamant that I (obviously) was expecting to receive a full refund. SHAME ON YOU, this is DESPICABLE. It is interesting to see how this turned out to benefit you and not me, how strange.Date of experience: 01 November 2020","1"

I rented a car and went to pick up at Khon Kaen Airport. Unfortunately, the supplier did not prepare a car for me due to they did not get the rental voucher from trip.com. I felt disappointed but the Thai Rent a Car agents there were really helpful to me. They helped me to find available car with another supplier in the airport. I was impressed. Then I contacted with Trip.com to report the issue and ask for full refund. Because I had to pay for another rental again. The process to solve my issue was not long as I thought and all the trip.com agents are great,especially the customer success team name Lana, was truly kind and helpful. And I was so impressed with an additional compensation. I will continue to use trip.com because of their service is really great, I could feel that they are really care about my issue.

"3973","Told 14 days to process 8m agoI bought a flight from Trip.com to Thailand in November 2019 for March 2020. The airline continuously played around with my flights to the point where nothing even made sense. Example: I was going from Bangkok to Thailand even before my flight from NY to Bangkok. I tried to switch the flights myself and Trip refused. I would call Trip, Trip would tell me to call the airline, I’d call the airline and the airline said I absolutely had to go through Trip. When I asked to speak to a supervisor to escalate the matter the woman refused and said she couldn’t because she was providing me with excellent service (b.s.) but basically was referring me back to the airline. I had to hang up and call again. The second woman was kinder and created an incident and told me I should be refunded in 14 days. This escalation took place in Feb 2020 we are now close to Nov 2020 and still nothing. There’s no point in calling because who ever picks up has no idea what’s going on and puts me on hold for 20 minutes to tell me they will start a new investigation. I accepted another agents “rushed” escalation in March but still nothing. Meanwhile, I have someone who keeps apologizing to me and telling me to be patient through email. It’s just crazy.I understand the circumstances are difficult and that’s why I have been trying to be so patient but the customer service is absolutely no help and obviously they don’t care about their clients. Worse customer service ever. I would suggest paying more and buying tickets elsewhere it’s not worth all the hassle.***Update*** Trip.com replied to this review pretending to care and be efficient and still nothing. Don’t let the reply fool you. They don’t care and won’t do anything about your problems.Date of experience: 30 October 2020","1"

"3975","Cancelled flights/ Lost MoneyAfter countless lost flights this year, which are understandable due to the current circumstances, I am having to keep rebooking and losing money in the process due to the fact that I have not been fully refunded for a single flight this year. The most recent experience being a BA flight cancelled on 21st November from ALC to Heathrow. I am frustrated at the fact that the money I paid to book a case on, which was more than the flight!, will not be refunded.. And this has happened to me several times this year also. It seems very wrong to me to keep making money out of this when I am not able to get on the flight at all, why should I not get the case money reimbursed also when the case too shall not be travelling on any flights?

I have since redeemed a flight voucher from Lufthansa and booked a free return flight from Addis Ababa where i frequent regularly. I had to phone Lufthansa Service Centre for around 50 minutes (their call rates are expensive) which was extremely frustrating and confusing due to being cut off twice and the flight booking they sent me is nearly 2 weeks after the date I requested.Consequently I have since deleted my original poor trip.com review and upgraded their star rating for their eventual positive response.Thanks to trustpilot.com for help in getting this response and thanks eventually to Trip.com i.e. Annabeth and Gaby for her call .Shaun malcDate of experience: 28 August 2020","4"

Should I mention that every singe time they promise me to follow up? How many times do you think I receive a call or e-mail from them? Zero. Well, no surprises here. I am calling out trip.com to respond for their actions. I encourage people to speak up for their rights for their own money they paid for the service they never received. And to never choose this company ever again.Date of experience: 24 July 2020","1"

"4038","So disappointed!About 10 of us booked Jetstar flights to Japan for August (flights book in January) which were cancelled due to Covid. My friends, who used a different online service (called ""I want that flight""), were refunded within weeks of the flight being cancelled. My partner and I are still waiting for our refund. We have called Jetstar and they told me a refund is available, but the delay is due to Trip.com. I am so disappointed. Are they trying to keep the refund themselves? Do they not expect repeat business? I had read some good reviews which is why I used them! I am lodging a complaint with Jetstar but I would highly suggest booking with ANY OTHER COMPANY.Date of experience: 23 July 2020","1"

"4040","Updated review for Gaby in Customer ServicesEdit and update of original review: I am changing my review from 1 star to 4. After posting my review, I was contacted by Gaby who is part of the management of customer services I believe. She went above and beyond to help me and managed to resolve my 3 pending refunds very quickly. I have now received my refunds which I am extremely happy about because it means I can finally move on from this horror of a situation. I would highly recommend anyone who is seeking proper help to try with Gaby, she was top class. This update is very much directed only to Gaby's help and whoever else advised her since I posted the review, not to anyone who was involved in multiple past attempts before my review who didn't treat me properly as a customer who spent a lot of money in their company.Old review: Trip.com are holding onto 3 flights to be refunded to me. They have lied to me continuously saying they are waiting for the airline to process the refund. I don't believe for one second that it takes 4 months to process a refund especially when the customer (me) has made contact with both airline and trip.com multiple times. All other airlines and third parties I have dealt with during this time have been extremely communicative, courteous and kind in giving back the money that I deserved, there was one airline that refunded me within seconds! I had 10 flights booked in total and low and behold only trip.com still pussyfoot around my money to this day. This company Trip.com has been the absolute worst and I will never book with them again believe me and you will find in the future your way of dealing with this situation is gonna bite you back in the ar*se you will regret not treating your customers right.

I requested a refund on 07/05/2020 - one month after the flight was cancelled (due to respecting their rules about only contacting Trip.com if you were in an emergency situation)They have NEVER responded to me when they said they would and I have had to constantly chase them. I could probably name the entire team due to how many times I have had to contact them. Every time I call, I get given the same response 'we have no record of any refund request'. I then have to spend 15 minutes trying to explain all the different emails I have had and how I ALREADY have a refund request that was submitted ONE MONTH AGO. When asking to speak to a manager, I am told their manager is 'not on duty' and suddenly they are able to find my refund request and recite all of their emails to me. They then continue with their usual script ""we will contact the airline for you"". The cycle starts again...  I am so disappointed. I always feel confused and frustrated after speaking to them and never have a resolution. All I want is a refund for the flight that was cancelled by the airline.

It was easy to add the flight to my account and when I cancelled the flight (under fee waiver rules) I was credited with all flight costs, in $, to my United account.The last flight was with Delta, however when I cancelled that flight (again with fee waiver rules) only the ticket in my names was credited to my account.Trip.com are currently chasing this on my behalf and have been very helpful with updates. ——With all that said I have faith that Trip.com are working hard to try and sort out this all out... we are in unprecedented times.Date of experience: 13 June 2020","4"

"4053","WHY IS THIS SITE NOT BLOCKED OR SHUT DOWN??What on earth?  How is this scam company getting any good reviews?   Honestly, I'm embarrassed that I did not check reviews before trying them out!  Do NOT EVER use this site.   I have experimented with a few online booking companies and this was the ONLY one that was truly a scam.   It showed up more than the others and seemed to be trustworthy.  I booked 2 nights near the site of my business travel and showed up before 6 PM.  The hotel had no record of my booking.  I was shocked (and the clerk was the most unfriendly gal I had encountered so I thought maybe she had something to do with this).  I gave my confirmation # first and she dismissed me again.  Then I showed the email.  I saw a number to call and was able to talk with someone.  I had to ask several times where the rep was located.  When she said China, I knew I had made a grave mistake.  She had me wait on hold to find out what had happened, then told me I had given the wrong name on the booking (how was that as I put in my credit card number with my name as well) and then told me that the hotel had cancelled my reservation.  She then put me on hold to find out what could be done.  I heard the clerk on the phone spelling my name and the clerk said there were no other rooms available.  A while later, the Chinese rep said she would investigate with the IT dept on whether the mistake was my fault or not.  Then she said she would try to find another booking for me.  Another long hold and she stated there were no other rooms available at all.  When I was able to get online again, I checked and found several places available -- thankfully!!!  She said it would take hours to find another hotel.  Thankfully, I did not have to depend on them!!  What a NIGHTMARE!!   They should be shut down.

I don't know why the whole ticket wasn't cancelled, trip. Com seems to think that i booked two one way tickets. I definitely selected RETURN when I booked and two flights were on this ticket. The return flight was rescheduled and then cancelled by the airline. Trip. com failed to inform me that the return flight was cancelled. I got an email from china now denying the return flight was canceled and i just didn't show up so its my fault and  lose the money. You would have to wonder how they expect me to board a flight in the first place when the outbound leg of a return ticket was cancelled, luckily for me both legs were cancelled.Legally. even if you no show you are entitled to a refund of all taxes so they are not telling the truth here either. Nevertheless, they say to get half a refund i need to cancel the ticket. It worries me that by cancelling the ticket myself i am losing my right to the refund and admitting liability. The airline cancelled, there is no fault on my part, the goods have not been supplied as agreed, the refund should be made and a good travel agent would refund the money.

They have good information on the ste-by-step process complaints against local & overseas travel agencies.Once you follow the step-by-step process above without success, you can make a formal complaint to International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN). You can also Google Ctrip.com Hong Kong Ltd or Trip.com Group Ltd for more public records regarding information on the company if required.

"4080","I strongly recommend avoiding Trip.com…I strongly recommend avoiding Trip.com for any travel arrangements. The customer service is appalling. I booked flights in January and spoke to a customer service agent in March regarding cancellation due to covid-19. The airline had advised my flights were cancelled and the payment had been referred back to the agent who booked on my behalf however, trip.com denied knowledge of this instead insisting that they would need to wait until at least April before reviewing the refund.After calling back in April after receiving an email advising my flights had been cancelled I was told the refund would take 10 days. I processed the refund myself and took a screenshot of the message and was happy to wait. After 10 days I phones back to be told it would take up to 30 days for the refund to land in my account as they were waiting on the airline to release the money back to them. I called the airline who advised the money had been returned in March and suggested I contact the ""agent"" again. This was another two phone calls of wasted time, trip.com were dismissive and did everything they could to get me off the phone.  The funny thing is had I chosen a ""change of mind"" refund in March and paid the appalling cancellation fee, I would have probably received my 30% refund by now. This is confusing to me as how would they be able to refund this to me straight away but now are unable to refund my flights? I contacted the hotels I'd booked through directly who refunded my bookings straight away. Additionally, I contacted the airline who advised their policy at this stage is to issue vouchers however, were offering refunds to customers who requested it directly. The customer service I've received from the airline who had nothing to do with me has been 100 times better than that of trip.com. Had I booked through the airline directly this issue would have been resolved, and this is confirmed through the multitude of reviews left online. At this stage, I've been told the refund will take 40-60 days, and no one is willing to escalate this matter further, despite the information I've been advised by the airline. In short, the customer service and follow up from trip.com has been absolutely appalling. I deeply regret not booking direct through the airline and would strongly urge anyone considering Trip.com to avoid them completely. It's not worth the hassle or the pain trying to negotiate and discuss anything.Date of experience: 04 May 2020","1"

The customer service number automatically cancels your call and forces you to use their app/website which promises a *full refund* minus any cancellation fees you are forced into paying. In my case it amounts to 60% of the original flight - not acceptable. Their attempt to profit during this time is absolutely disgusting. I'm even more angered having checked directly with the airline, their policy allows full refund or voucher regardless of whether the flight was booked through trip.com or directly with them.As it stands I will not use their service ever again and I strongly recommend that nobody else does.Date of experience: 08 April 2020","1"
"4084","Cannot get refund on already cancelled flight!My flight has been cancelled due to COVID-19 and Trip.com are trying to charge me a cancellation fee of nearly £100. Which is half of what the flight is even worth. I've tried to call their helpline multiple times but every time it cuts out. No one to speak to about this directly, only giving options to charge ridiculous amounts for already cancelled flights. I've spoken to the airline directly and they would issue a full refund, it's only due to being booked through Trip.com that this is not happening.

"4087","Horrible customer service and no refund after 10-12 weeks.I have had an extremely the bad experience with Trip.com. My airline suddenly cancels my booking due to the corona outbreak. I try to reschedule the flight, that failed as the airline stopped all flights indefinitely. I try to refund my ticket and buy a new one, I was told the refund would take 10-14 working days. I then had to buy new tickets with another airline, all at my own expense. I have waited patiently since February 2020 for my refund. I have phoned several times to find out the status of my refund and was told several times that it’s being processed and that they will escalate the priority and I must be patient. After waiting 4 weeks I get an email that was very poorly written and gives no reasons for and states I must reapply for my refund, which I did. I then waited another 4 weeks, no communication from trip.com, I phone them again just to be told I would only be refunded 10 percent of my ticket amount, causing me to lose a substantial amount of money. I then proceeded to negotiate and read their own refund policy to them which was a day to night difference to what was suppose happen in my situation. They then told me that they will escalate it to a manager/specialist and provide feedback via email. That was 2 weeks ago. I phoned them again this morning, only to be placed on hold for 20 minutes then the call disconnected, phone again and at least the call was stable, spoke to consultant and it's as all my calls, refund requests over the last 10 weeks never happened. I then had request my third refund for the same ticket and now I will only receive 10 percent and have to wait 30 days. This is appalling and disgusting customer service. I will endeavor to never use their services again. I have the deepest sympathies for the difficult time that all travel agencies are going through but this is just a very good illustration of horrible customer service and support. Travelers must know how horrible Trip.com’s customer service is during a crisis period so that they steer clear of Trip.com and choose a travel agent that has their best interests at heart and can provide basic support. Trip.com has officially lost me as a customer. Steer clear of this company. There are many travel agencies out there that are far better at treating customers with respect and fully honor their own refund policies.Date of experience: 08 April 2020","1"

"4100","Refused to refund my ticket after airline cancelled flight due to COVID-19I had a flight booked from Melbourne, Australia to New York on March 31. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, QANTAS canceled the flight on March 20. As I made the mistake of booking through Trip.com, on the assumption it was a legitimate site, QANTAS was unable to help me rebook or cancel my flight.I have contacted Trip,com almost every day since the flight was canceled. Attempting to change the flight would cost me over $1,000 which is absolutely ridiculous. I decided to apply for a refund. I was directed to cancel on the website, which I did. My cancellation request was subsequently rejected for reasons they refused to communicate. I submitted another cancellation request and the same thing happened. I hopped on the phone and an operator who was really giggly and seemed like her had no idea what was going on laughed and assured me I'd get the full refund in my bank account in 14 days and that I'd receive an email detailing this by the end of the day. I didn't. With March 31st looming, I submitted several other cancellation requests and made more phone calls, each as unhelpful as the last. Finally, I was offered a measly $235 refund which Trip.com stated was because I canceled my flight I was only able to be refunded the taxes associated with the $1650 flight. I sent a follow-up email asking why, only to now be told I would now not be receiving any refunds because my flight had ""departed"" and I had contacted Trip.com too late. I have been on the phone with Trip.com since March 20, since the airline canceled the flight and no one ever offered me a refund until it was too late. And now I have to absorb the cost AND book another flight back home. The pandemic has truly exposed Trip.com for the scam it is. This is inhumane and despicable and I strongly advice against booking anything from this site to anyone.Date of experience: 06 April 2020","1"
"4101","Not trustworthy - use of 'suppliers' who are willing to rip you off.Personally, would have to recommend not booking with this company.. Was booking a hotel room for two nights for a music festival.  Hotel was the DoubleTree by Hilton at London ExCel, so thought a decent hotel brand to associate with.Found out on the Thursday evening that the music festival was cancelled amongst all the Coronavirus outbreak, due to arrive on Friday.  Couldn't get through that evening but did the next morning.  They put in a request to their 'supplier'.. Just a week later, found that this 'supplier' won't give the refund, even though on Hilton's website they have updated their policy to accommodate for the virus outbreak.  I appreciate that this is with the supplier that won't assist, but the fact that if I'm booking a room or whatever, I don't have any faith in Trip.com at all if they are using third and fourth party booking companies.  Fingers burned, definitely won't be associating with this company again.Date of experience: 20 March 2020","1"
"4102","Awful customer services, terrible processesWorst travel company I've ever booked through.Return flight from Amsterdam to Manchester with Flybe was cancelled in early February due to a storm.  FlyBe correctly advised me to arrange a refund via Trip.com as the booking operator.  Since then I've been passed from pilar to post on various phone calls.  Initial calls with Trip.com resulted in them incorrectly claiming the flight had departed with me on it, something they failed to understand wasn't possible as the flight was cancelled and all information evidenced this.  Following this they insisted I provided proof of cancellation, of which I forwarded them copies of the cancellation notices (emails and SMS) from FlyBe.  Next it was a case of they couldn't use this as they still believed I was on the CANCELLED flight.  They insisted they must wait for FlyBe to contact them, even though they could of contacted FlyBe themselves.  Various calls with Trip.com resulted in failed promises to return calls, failures to record complaints when I had directly specified I wanted to to do, and now I'm still waiting for my refund after being told a couple of weeks ago that it had been approved.... Why? Because apparently a refund takes 30 days.  What complete and utter rubbish...Never will I be booking through Trip.com again, a shambles of a company with no regard for customer service.

The problem is that it has been a month and a half since the flight was cancelled and I still have not received a refund for the tickets. They told me this was under approval, then received an email stating that because they are busy they will reply to me later, maybe after 30 Days. This is clearly not acceptable...

I do hope they will update their website to make it more user-friendly and intuitive in the future, but overall I'm satisfied with the experience I had in the end. Original Review: This is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had with any travel company. My flight was canceled due to a lockdown/COVID19. The airline's website says they will give customers a refund, and yet my booking on Trip.Com does not reflect this. I cannot get answers from anyone and can barely navigate the website. Every time I try to figure out what to do, the chat feature tells me I can access everything ""easily"" but this is not true. Trip.com is taking advantage of customers during a global pandemic. If they expect anyone to use their company in the future, they must treat their customers properly. I do not plan to ever go through Trip.Com again, and I will tell everyone I know to do the same.Date of experience: 19 March 2020","4"

"4122","Unacceptable Refund HandlingI am writing out of frustration of how my refund request has been handled. I have been served the runaround back and forth with this issue between ANA and Trip.com. I had spoken to ANA and 2 other reps from Trip.com yesterday about my situation with the Coronavirus escalation and the subsequent Level 2 designation for Japan. The CDC, the US embassy in Tokyo, and the state department have all advised against non essential travel to Japan since this past Saturday due to the continued spread of the Coronavirus. Per my conversations with ANA and the 2 reps from Trip.com last night, they assured me that I will be getting a full refund due to the unprecedented circumstances. I even repeatedly asked for reassurance from the reps and they told me not to worry as my full refund will be granted. Today, I was informed that I will only be getting the taxes back due to the airline policy which is still stuck with the “China only” stance even though the virus situation has significantly gotten worse overnight this past weekend with new cases in Japan and countries such as South Korea, Iran, and Italy.  I was provided conflicting information and now I have no choice but to accept the loss of my airfare minus the taxes even though this was not the case yesterday per my conversations with the 2 reps and ANA. ANA actually said that I shouldn’t be calling them since the tickets were bought from Trip.com and not directly through the airline which gives Trip.com the authority and upper hand to decide about the refund. This has been a very stressful and disappointing experience as I was supposed to run the Tokyo Marathon but they canceled it due to the worsening Coronavirus situation. I had used Trip.com many times in the past and never had this terrible experience until now. I have been tossed around with no resolution to the issue and I had no choice but to accept the taxes only refund as opposed to the full which was promised to me yesterday. I want this email forwarded to the top executives at Trip.com so they can see what I’ve been put through. I have many runner friends in the same situation and they were all given full refunds. Even my hotel and all of my excursions in Japan were very gracious in giving me full refunds as they understood the severity of the situation and that it’s beyond anyone’s control. I hope to get a quick response from Trip.com’s management about the mishandling of my refund request. I sure hope that Trip.com will do the right thing and keep their customers happy and satisfied as business relies heavily on customer satisfaction.

Trip said refund was ""canceled"", but also said I was due $470. Why is it canceled? Where is my $$? I paid Trip not China Southern. Now they said will re-apply for refund and I have to wait again. This is nonsense. No liability for Trip. Its like purchasing a defective wash machine from Home Depo, taking it back and Home Deop applying with Maytag to refund the $$. As the Trip representative said: they said they are just the ""middle man"". Looks like Trips service is pretty poor. May have to seek remedy with my credit card company.

"4134","BAD. TERRIBLE - Don’t buy with trip.comSo, I have booked a return flight (HKG to KUL) with trip.com. The flight was with Malaysia airline (MAS).Due to Coronavirus outbreak, MAS has announced on its website that they will refund any flight between HKG and KUL for tickets issued before 28-Jan-2020. Trip.com issued my return ticket way before 28-Jan-2020.With both the concern on the virus outbreak and MAS announcement on the refunds, I have emailed and called trip.com at least two days ago before my scheduled flight, asking them what should I do to process this refund. In the call, I have also notified them MAS announcement and also emailed them screenshot and link to the announcement. So I did everything as told by trip.com and now, trip.com refused my refund.I am so confused. I called MAS and they said if I were to book with them, I would definitely be refunded. I don’t understand why trip.com refused my refund. Honestly, I feel cheated with my hard earned money.Yes, you do save some money by booking your flight with trip.com, but the pressure, time and effort to deal with them on refund is really nerve wrecking and disappointing. I have called trip.com every two days trying to understand the situation and each operator tells me diff things. And not to mention, most of their operators have really bad customer service.I am extremely disappointed with trip.com.How is my flight different from any other MAS passenger that you are refusing refund on my returned ticket. You are definitely discouraging return purchase from existing clients. This is my first and definitely the LAST time buying ticket with trip.com.I am definitely going to spread this negative encounter of mine to all my friends and family and on social media so everyone is aware of this.I feel cheated with my hard earned money, and i regret buying my tickets from trip.com.Please refund me.Date of experience: 22 February 2020","1"

Called hotel to cancel and they said to claim the refund through trip. Finally got through after two disconnections and was told to wait on the line as couldn't cancel booking as button on computer wouldn't let them. 30 minutes later finally came back on the line and told me cant cancel booking and couldn't get through to person they tried ringing as engaged. Asked why this took 30 minutes to leave me on line to tell me that and was told sorry sir and put back on hold. Disgrace and will not use again.Date of experience: 21 February 2020","1"

"4139","Booked a  flight to Malta with Trip…Booked a  flight to Malta with Trip and got no confirmation email so booked a different flight with a different company only to find I had now booked two flights. When I contacted Trip the gentleman seemed to have difficulty with my email so then sent it to finance and told me (after originally wanting to ring me back at 5 in the morning) that I would get a ring back at 9am the following day. 9am came and went no sign of a call. I rang back to be told that I couldn't be found on the system even though it showed on my transactions that money had gone out to Trip.com. I was then told to email a screenshot which I did still no reply and it's a week and a half before I go.UPDATEGabby has been liaising with me nearly every day they have offered to refund £30(I have filled out the application). Trying to cancel the flight due to having booked another flight has been anything but easy. I have even contacted Iberia myself to try see what they could do. At this stage I just want the flight cancelled fail to see how hard that is. I have learned my lesson and will not be giving trip.com £210.85 or indeed any sum of money again. However I do acknowledge that my email address from  what I have been told and presented was wrong. If I must I may seek advice to see what obligations etc trip would have on their part to ensure that the process of cancelation runs smoothly.Date of experience: 20 February 2020","1"
"4140","[Updated Review] Tickets refund credited successfullyI would like to change my review here. I had booked a round trip from Singapore to Delhi. On arriving in Delhi, I had rescheduled my return and paid extra 128$(SGD) for the new ticket. I now wanted to cancel my rescheduled ticket as well. But sadly i could not do so through the App or website. I shared my experience here and Hannah from Trip Customer Care approached me. She not only refunded the whole 128$ back but also a partial refund (80$) of the original unused ticket. Hannah deserves all the credit for the way she followed up with my request in a very professional manner. Thanks Trip.com.Date of experience: 20 February 2020","5"

This is because air company is sending notifications to whatever email you/agent is providing to them. And Trip.com doesn't provide them your email.2) Customer service... pretty much non existent. Probably being outsources to some 3rd world country (which is ok) and nobody in Trip.com cares to properly train customer support people and you basically have to send dozens of emails to get an answer a simple question.Date of experience: 26 January 2020","1"

"4154","Trip.com refusing to return money owedI have booked many flights with trip.com. However this most recent experience has made me never want to use them again and I work in the travel industry.I had a flight booked from Nassau to Miami in Nov 2919 with a Bahamas Air through Trip.com. The airline changed the flight time and it meant that I would miss my connect flight back to the UK. They state due to the airline changing the flight and not myself I was entitled to a full refund of £350.I had to rebook at my own expense to make it to Miami in time and apply for a refund from the airline which I did within their timeframe and policy guidelines after speaking directly to the airline. The airline then refunded the card paid with the money. However like many third party travel bookers trip.com paid with a virtual credit card which was then refunded. For two months now I have been trying to get them to refund me the money I am owed and being passed off at every turn. They now say I am not eligible for the refund even though it has been granted by the airline meaning they are pocketing my money. Awful company. Awful service.

Trip.com helped me find a new flight want when that wasn't possible, trip.com refunded my money in full. both for the flight and for the hotel I had booked earlier. This is great I think, but the only reason trip.com could not find me a new flight was because they could not change the city of departure of the arrival city. I kinda of understand this but the fact is the city I booked from no lo0nger had a direct flight to my arrival city  but another nearby city did have a direct flight. So, I am happy how it worked out  but perhaps if trip.com had allowed me to change the city of departure earlier I did not have cancel my flight which required a great deal of rearranging.

"4186","It was a good experience when I booked…It was a good experience when I booked my round trip flight ticket from Taipei to San Francisco. The booking process was simple to follow, and I like the fact that I can see all the ticket terms and conditions in the booking process (e.g. cancellation and change policy, baggage policy). However, I found that the ""change schedule"" process is terrible. I need to change my flying date from 1/20/2020 to 1/16/2020, so I called to the help desk and asked for help. The customer service person was polite. What I don't appreciate was that he/she cannot make the ""change"" for me right away, although they saw vacancy available at the time I called in. He/she told me that they have to send my request to another department at Trip.com, and let them contact the Airline to confirm if I can make the change accordingly. The whole confirmation process took around 2 hours. What's worst was that the help desk can only process one flight schedule at one time. I would like them to find available seat for me & my wife at any ""class"" at Economy, and any flight on 1.16.2020. The help desk said I have to designate one flight schedule only.  I was upset because seats were limited. The RESULT was bad. Around 2 hours later, the email came in and said “we regret to inform you that your requested date cannot be changed since there is not economy class seats."" The seat was available when I called in, but the seat was not available when I received the replied email. After several attempt (called in to the help desk a few times), I got seats for me and my wife at Premium Economy class, and end up paying ""extra"" RMB 5100/2 person. Isn't it ridiculous. How can you keep your customer happy? Making flight date changes should be hassle free. The help desk should be able to check flight availability at the time I call in. Also, your help desk should be able to contact the AIRLINE and find out if the changes is available right away. I can make decision right at the call without wasting 2 hours to get confirmation (Waiting 2 hours is too long. Seats can be gone. Just like what happen in my case).  I probably would not buy airline tickets through Trip.com again, until I see improvement on this issue.Date of experience: 30 December 2019","2"

"4215","Never again! NOOIT MEER!(NL review onderaan)Plus jamais! NUNCA MAS! Nie wieder!Booked a flight with SkyAirlines in August (price € 39.86) via trip.com. Afterwards, flight by flight number can no longer be found. When filling in the booking number at the airline, another flight number appears with a different departure time. Originally booked flight can no longer be found. Called to trip.com, they do not find flight and find it strange ... They will sort it out ... Called back is still no solution. After I phone them (expensive number in Shanghai € 2 / min from Belgium and they keep you on the line), and after I have e-mailed several times because of the problem, they suddenly send an email out of the blue to let them know that the flight times have been changed and the flight can be canceled, and they want to assist us with this. Come on, call them again? In the meantime had already lost € 40 on calling. Canceled the flight and booked a new flight (cost € 122.72, no cheaper to find).When I want to find out what happened, why the purchased flight suddenly no longer exists, they say that I should ask SkyAirline. At SkyAirline they say that I have to inquire at trip.com. No one takes his responsibility. But given that I made the booking at Trip.com, I think they should resolve this. But they just refer us. Easily make money like this.Weeks later still no compensation from their side.They sold a flight that does not exist, money has arrived, and we have 39.86 + 122.72 + 40 costs.In augustus vlucht met SkyAirlines geboekt (prijs € 39,86) via trip.com. Nadien is vlucht op vluchtnummer niet meer te vinden. Bij invullen boekingsnummer bij de airline verschijnt een ander vluchtnummer met andere vertrektijd. Oorspronkelijk geboekte vlucht is niet meer terug te vinden. Gebeld naar trip.com, zij vinden vlucht ook niet en vinden het raar... Ze zullen het uitzoeken... Terug gebeld nog altijd geen oplossing. Nadat ik hen via telefoon (duur nummer in Shangai €2/min vanuit België en ze houden je aan het lijntje), en nadat ik verschillende keren gemaild heb ivm het probleem, sturen ze zomaar uit het niets plots een mailtje om te laten weten dat de vluchttijden gewijzigd zijn en de vlucht geannuleerd kan worden, en zij ons hierbij willen assisteren. Komaan zeg, hen nog eens opbellen? Was ondertussen al €40 kwijt aan bellen. Zelf de vlucht geannuleerd en een nieuwe vlucht geboekt (kostprijs €122,72, geen goedkopere meer te vinden).Wanneer ik dan wil achterhalen wat er juist gebeurd is, waarom die gekochte vlucht plots niet meer bestaat, zeggen ze dat ik dat bij SkyAirline moet vragen. Bij SkyAirline zeggen ze dat ik moet informeren bij trip.com. Bij trip.com beweren ze dat ze ons geïnformeerd hebben over de wijziging zodra ze hiervan op de hoogte gesteld werden. Ja, zij werden door ons op de hoogte gesteld en sturen ons dan dat verplichte mailtje dat er wijziging van de vlucht is. Niemand neemt zijn verantwoordelijkheid op. Maar gezien ik de boeking deed bij Trip.com vind ik dat zij dit moeten oplossen. Maar ze verwijzen ons gewoon door. Makkelijk geld verdienen zo.Weken later nog altijd geen tegemoetkoming van hun kant. Zij verkochten een vlucht die niet bestaat, geld is binnen, en wij zitten met de kosten € 39,86 + € 122,72 + € 40.Date of experience: 21 December 2019","1"

I feel like a sucker & having been conned. I am fuming mad/furious!What happened:This morning, I did a booking at your website for SIN-BKK-SIN (Jetstar) & your fares was S$60 (per pax, return) HIGHER than if I had booked direct with Jetstar!!!!!!! (checked 15minutes later). Never mind that, I wasn't even given a chance to purchase additional baggage during the booking process at Trip.com (which is usual for budget airlines). And the virtual assistant informed me that I have to purchase separately. Later they sent me a quote: S$46 for 20kg vs S$24 for same if I had done my booking via Jetstar. I was BOILING MAD! I called them & they refused to budge, with all sorts of excuses - airline partners fares, service charges, bla bla bla.Trip.com is definitely not a $-friendly portal for travellers. It looks like it's out to suck travellers' $$$Feeling totally totally disappointed and cheated,Mrs Ivy LiowSingaporeDate of experience: 05 December 2019","1"

The result of ticket shows that there was no self-transited by booking two tickets from Taiwan to Sri Lanka. I called the customer hot line at the same day when I tried to figure out whether I would have to transit by myself on 6th/Nov/2019. The customer hot line told me that I have to figure out by myself because I am living in Taiwan. I was confused, so that I called them another two times afterward. Finally, I received a phone call from their call centre where there is a lady told me that she wanted me to send her the screenshot, so that she would be able to verify whether I said was correct the next day. Because she told me that she couldn't find that ticket available on the website (That is very untrue as I tried to book the same ticket on skyScanner, I can still find the same package (Thai-smile+Sri lanka airline)Today is 18/Nob/2019, I received the feedback. The lady told me that the same reason that they did show their self-transited on the ticket ??? I didn't understand if they thought that they have nothing wrong, why did they request me to send them the screenshot. I strongly recommended people to be very careful if you try to book any ticket from Trip.com. In my own opinion, they are very rude and dishonest company as they only tried to cheat people to buy their ticket online.

"4339","fraudI will never book anything from trip.com again. I booked high-speed rail tickets on trip.com to travel within China (bearing the additional booking fee) thinking I will be able to enjoy the service I paid for and have a hassle-free ticket purchasing experience. However, they charged my credit card but failed to deliver the tickets due to certain issues which the customer service was not even clear about. In most online transactions, payment is withheld until the product is able to be delivered to the client. Hence, when I saw the receipt that my payment gone through, I did not expect that there would be a problem. Moreover, I feel weary using this website because they did not immediately refund my money when they can’t deliver the tickets. The website also did not prompt or do a follow up when trip.com failed to help me get my tickets. They only offered to refund me because they do not want to deal with my problem (I found out this 8 hours before I was suppose to board my train). The customer service is not equipped with information and can offer no help but issue you a refund. FYI, they do not even have an official refund email, the person I talked to typed it on spot and send to me. Very shady. Do not recommend, high chance you will get your money cheated and have a hard time finding alternatives if it’s last minute.Date of experience: 31 October 2019","1"

"4355","Love the low flight ticket fares!Some of the flight tickets price are truly unbeatable! I search various platforms at once and Trip seems to offer much lower price for some Asian routes.. The only minus is that many time when I see a ticket and try to book it, I go through all the steps to receive a notice that the ticket is no longer available (yes they don't put you on a temporary payment hold). Funny thing is that the next day, and then the next next day, that price and that ticket still pops up on the list! But if you click on it, you still get the same notice...

I then went to double check with the service chat (which is terrible) because there is no sound notification to tell you when an agent has been allocated to you, making me miss my agent several times whilst waiting and then was told that the option had not appeared there because I had to directly contact the agent to add additional checked luggage AND that my checked luggage had only been added to my return flight with no option to transfer the checked baggage to my other flight even though it's an national flight and 5 days in advance.

This is a complete lie as Air Asia confirmed earlier that my ticket include airport tax, and Air Asia agent I talked to one month ago agreed to refund our airport tax paid for our ticket.Do not trust trip.com, as they are willing to tell lies to refuse to give refund of our airport tax paid which the airline has confirmed its policy allows such refund.My ticket number is XTQJPG, My trip.com booking number is 8319480198.

I distinctively remembered that I've selected a 2:45am flight for my trip to Seoul and when the booking came through, it turns out to be for 10:50pm. Initially thought it was my mistake and called them immediately to rectify it but they refused and insisted that I had to pay an extra $300 each passenger in order to have it rectified. Went back to check on my browsing history - clearly never clicked for the 10:50pm flight AT ALL and was on with the 2:45am flight throughout, read up reviews on them and realised they are indeed a scam company. I don't understand why do I have to pay so much extra for a system error that clearly isn't my fault. This just happened tonight and it's so frustrating and stressful to be dealing with this level of service and honestly terrible system especially when I had to spend extra 2 hours of my bedtime trying to get this resolved.Date of experience: 23 July 2019","1"

I went to rebook the room and as soon as i clicked the room it said sold out. Ok so i reload to book a different room, well now all the rooms are bumped up $20 including the room that was “sold out” i click the room to book again & again i get the message that the room is “sold out” i reload the page AGAIN only to see the same room bumped up $30 more. Lol i went to a different hotel booking agency. These people price gauge. They will say your room is sold out just to list it at an astronomical rate compared to every other company. Well you just lost a customer for life and many more to come. After reading your reviews it looks like I’m not the only one who has this problem. My job has me travel for a living, this company just lost out on thousands i will take my business elsewhere(UPDATE: the rep for the company below stated my card didn’t go through which is what i previously stated..it’s the fact that when i went back to use a different card they had severely raised the prices. OH & like the reply says below from the company don’t use them if you are in a hurry) MEANING THEY ARE NOT DEPENDABLE. I took my business to findhotel.com and purchased the same room for the same price they originally offered before trip.com attempted to PRICE GAUGE) oh & btw my card was fine i used it on findhotel.com and will continue to take my business elsewhere along with making sure how awful this company and their customer service is.New update: they say their prices are “ever CHANING” LOL look above to seeAnywayif it’s not “Channing Tatum” that lasts less then 2 minutes i don’t care.

"4527","ENDED UP SPENDING MORE THAN SAVINGUPDATE 8/2/19: Trip.com contacted me and worked really hard with me to pay the difference in my luggage fees. It was definitely not a full refunded price difference, but it was something. I appreciate the customer service this time around and I know it can be complicated with all the foreign currency conversions. Thank yall.ORIGINAL:DO NOT USE. They did not give me an option to buy baggage so I thought “oh maybe it will be an add on option later when it’s closer to the flight.” Well, it never came up again. Tried using the reservation code on the airline website to but luggage but it would not work. Tried contacting the airline via phone and email but never got through because it was an international airline without much customer support. Contacted trip.com to try to get them to contact the airline because buying luggage at the gate would be double the price. They were absolutely no help because apparently I needed to contact them “3 days” before my flight. Well contacted them well before 3 days for the return flight and they charged me for the luggages and then informed me that they couldn’t get through to the airline so they could not buy my bags. THEN they said if I wanted my money back I could REQUEST FOR A REFUND for a service that they couldn’t provide!!!! Why would the refund not be automatic at that point? Anyway, spent way more money fixing their problems (aka had to buy luggage at the gate) than the money I saved booking through them. I’ve used other 3rd party agencies that were not this bad.

"4621","Good but somewhat confusing and non transparent.Trip.com have good deals price wise for flights. Making the booking for the flights was ok..HOWEVER I am not happy about having had  the booking split up into 2 separate ones since I am 1 adult plus 2 small children (4 and 6 years young).Normally, agencies insist on putting the adult onto the same booking or reservation as the children as children must fly with an adult.  That makes sense to me since the 3 of us are travelling together.But Trip.com's way did not make sense to me.  I was booked on a separate booking number. The two children on another. Did not have any oversight.Also the cost or price presentation was not transparent to me at all.  The TOTAL amount paid for  ALL THE 3 OF US, was displayed on the kids separate flight reservation/booking.And then MY SEPARATE booking and amount/price for flight ticket, was displayed on this separate booking with led me to believe that I was charged one flight additionally. I found this very confusing and called their helpline.  They explained and sounded sincere and professional and friendly but I was not convinced 100%.

An email was sent from a diff name of trip.com demand my passport and my wife passport, otherwise the ticket would be cancelled. We were left with only a few days.

"4678","WORST EXPERIENCE EVER - NO CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONI booked return flights with Trip.com. 3 days before my flight i damaged my bak badly. I called the airline to check if I could upgrade under compassionate circumstances to a lie-flat bed as I can't sit. They said it would be possible and Trip.com would just have to call them. I contacted Trip.com who advised me it would be possible and that I should send through a doctor certificate. I did this and was told someone would respond in 2 hours due to its urgency. I then called 3 times during the day to say it was 'in process' yet it had taken them 9 hours to even download my doctors certificate.  An agent told me it hadn't been listed as urgent as I had previously been told. I asked for someone to call me back to update me and and I kept receiving email sin response saying it was 'in process'. The airline said they had seats available. My flight is now in 10 hours and I was told this morning the airline had not responded to them, I was called back an hour later to say the airline had responded yesterday afternoon but no one looked into it. Between yesterday afternoon the airline has now sold out of the seats and due to the incompetence, and of care for people with medical conditions, constant lying and disorganisation I am left with no options 10 hours before I am due to board my flight. A flight in which I will be standing for 9 hours overnight which will cause more damage to my back as a result of Trip.com.I am a young, healthy woman and this has ever happened to me before, I am shocked, upset and astounded at how I have been treated and the lack of care Trip.com have shown for people with medical conditions/and or disabilities. Please do not use this company, it is worth spending a bit of extra money to deal with a company that cares about peoples health and well being. I am making and formal complaint and requesting reimbursement for wasting my time, leaving me with no options and ultimately causing my health to deteriorate as a result of their actions.Date of experience: 17 April 2019","1"

The interface as a little basic and not entirely straightforward, but this shouldn’t deter you, it’s still more than easy to use. A great benefit for those travelling and booking domestic flights internationally is that Trip can often Bill you in your local currency, avoiding harsh exchange fees from your bank.

"4739","Amended date of departure without any hassleI have book a wrong date for my friend's spouse departing ShenZhen to GuiYang. I though this time will sure be a hassle to do amendment this and that. As previously i did call and check with airline company and they say that 3rd party website have to email them for refund and then book again. I was surprise that Trip.com was seamlessly in doing that and i manage to amend it within the next 15min with a nominate fees. Keep it up the good job. Now will wait for his wife departure and hope that everything is in fine. Thank you Trip.com once again.Date of experience: 06 March 2019","5"
"4740","Trip.com is sketchyI  was looking at flights through Google flights and the one from Tokyo to Hanoi for flight.com came up as the cheapest and I proceeded without scrolling much further. Turns out directly booking through the airline was only $1 more expensive.... And more legitimate. You're not able to make any changes within the first 24 hours as with a normal agency, my time change for a later flight which I tried to do an hour later cost me half the price of the ticket itself, the first reference trip.com gave me was for some other flight earlier in the year, then over the next few months I kept getting trip request changes. The website interface is sketchy and it was difficult every time I tried to access these changes.Date of experience: 06 March 2019","1"
