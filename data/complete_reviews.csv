"these are a reprint of three short stories that have previously appeared in other anthologies. they are very good stories as ususal for this author. however, publishers and book sellers need to warn their buyers that these are tired old reprints!!",TRUE
"this book was okay, though definitly not the best in the series. the writing was good and discriptive, though it didn't grab me in quite the same way as the first trilogy did, or even as the two books before this one did. to me, it seemed that this whole book was a rehash of the previus one. it had practicly the same plot, except uldir finally went just a little to far. and they had to bring the orloc guy back. i don't think he is a very good villian, because he is too unsure of himself, and he doesn't even have any real powers. his very presence insults the intelligence of the characters, and the fact that all of them are jedi, or at least jedi trainees except uldir. like i said, the writing was good, and the characters well developed, even if the plot was less than perfect. and despite it's flaws, i greatly enjoyed reading it, and intend to do so again. definitly best for children twelve and under.",TRUE
"the expanded new edition of a classic book collector's market guide provides full color and plenty of detail, updating prices for over 5,000 books and using charts to help identify first editions --which can be a tricky process, as publisher's marks vary from publisher to publisher. a new chapter on children's books has been added, while top ten lists of rarities and an alpha listing by author makes it quick and easy to use this as a take-along tote for flea market ventures.diane c. donovancalifornia bookwatch",TRUE

"i love belle and sebastian. this album is so beautiful, yet it is unlike all of their others. there are a lot more strings, yet most of the songs are very spare. stuart murdoch's voice maintains it's fragility (especially on, """"""""the chalet lines,"""""""" """"""""i fought in a war,"""""""" and, """"""""there's too much love""""""""), and even sounds sexy at times (like the lusty, """"""""don't leave the light on baby,""""""""). belle and sebastian are no doubt a very important band right now, especially in a time when mainstream music is not at it's best, and, """"""""fold your hands child, you walk like a peasant,"""""""" is an essential album.",TRUE

"the first book to explain the historical interlacing of the independant american spirit with the allure of that most enigmatic machine, the motorcycle. everyone who rides understands this sense of spirit and freedom. bad boys on bad toys was a fiction created by the meida. the intertwining of that fiction with the rise in popularity of the era of the cowboy is explored historically and romantically. this book explains that saying motorcycle saying """"""""if i have to explain you wouldn't understand"""""""" to both riders and non-riders alike. easy to read, fasinating connections made.",TRUE
"purchased this as a stocking stuffer for christmas. it is a hit with all the kids in the house and never fails to elicit a response and a chuckle from everyone who sees it. it is not a regulation sized football and it is soft and foamy, which suits me just fine. it is a cute, fun, reasonably priced unique toy.",TRUE
"thank goodness john matteson has alerted us to the evil agenda of captain & tennille! pity it's 30 years after the fact. nevertheless, i will now be on guard against any further acts of dastardly subversion by this most notorious of acts.seriously, though, anyone getting angry about this most innocuous of acts - it's akin to being furious with abba, or even tony orlando & dawn! - has a problem understanding the function of commercial pop music. i have happy memories of song of joy from my childhood, and although my taste in music is now considerably more sophisticated c&t; can still bring a smile to my face: that was their job, and this album still works.",TRUE
i enjoy biographies and this was one of the best. in fact it was so interesting and well written that i put it down reluctantly. entertainingly written the author used factual information gleaned from diaries and journals to carry the reader on a spellbinding adventiure spanning decades. i will certainly read more of mary lovell's books.,TRUE
"i'm not sure what anyone is saying about not being able to follow the story line. it's similar in concept to nicolas cage's movie """"""""the family man."""""""" i thought this movie was quite good and i am very picky about what i keep in my library. it wasn't the best christmas movie i have but it was definitely worth keeping and watching traditionally.",TRUE
"i really like this, it works great for bath toys and there is a little shelf for shampoo which is very handy and you can hang things of all the toes of the frog. plus the holes in the scoop are really nice to rinse the bath toys(like getting all the bubbles off). the reason i didn't give it a five stars is because the suction cups are not that great, it always fell off eventually and good thing there were several ways of attaching it otherwise i would have returned it, you can either use the double sided sticky tape (that's what i did) or you can screw it in which there was no way i was gonna do that to my tiled shower.",TRUE
"overall, well-written, well-researched, well-done. authoritative without being unapproachable to the less-than dead-serious movie monster fan. and yet, while one hestitates to criticize a godzilla book for having *too* much godzilla, one also can't help but wonder, why exactly *is* godzilla, japan's favorite """"""""mon-star,"""""""" as it were? where does angilas figure into all this? and what of that jaguar jet fellow? ... in any case, a small quibble. i'll put it on my shelf next to """"""""love story"""""""" anyday! and how!",TRUE

"when i first saw previews for this film it didn't interest me at all as it looked too cheesey and bland. but after hearing all the rave reviews from friends and the media i decided to take a chance and i'm glad i did by the end of the movie i walked out of the theater in awe. this movie had everything i could ask for -action/adventure/comedy/suspence/romance/horror all wrapped into one. plus not to mention a great cast that just made the movie more outstanding. johnny depp is one of the most elite actors out there today and his portrayal of captain jack sparrow is beyond belief.pirates of the caribbean was a welcomed surprise as every now and then a movie that comes out that manages to capture lightning in a bottle, this film does that flawlessly. i can only hope that the sequel will be just as good.the 2 disc dvd set has loads of extras from concept art to deleted scenes and will keep you entertained for hours on end.this is a must have for anyone's movie collection!",TRUE
"if you have enough room in your workshop, then you need a good worckbench. this is the one. it was easily assembled in about 20 minutes and was perfectly flat and true. i wouldn't call it a heavy-duty bench, but is is pretty heavy. i don't know how i got along without. i used to use the right side table of my table saw to assemble all my furniture, but that is no comparison to this. the clamps work well and the surface is excellent. even glue doesn't stick to it. if you have an extra 6' of space in your workshop, give this bench a try. it is worth every penny of the price. the only downside i see is that it doesn't have a built-in tool tray on the work surface. other than that, this bench is great.",TRUE

"at times plays like a more accessible cocteau twins, benefiting from clean production, crisp hooks, and memorable underplayed choruses. some songs cannot seem to nail the graceful songwriting which filters through to at least half of these tracks, but seldom has the current crop of overdone, retro-indie rockers been on display with such sincerity and consistency.",TRUE
"frank herbert's masterfully crafted book, dune, is one of the best books i have ever read. set on a wonderfully unique world arakis, aka dune, this book follows the life of paul muad'dib. i do not want to give away any more plot points than that. however, if you are a science fiction fan, you will love this book. the story, characters, technology, and world are all wonderfully crafted. the writing style is wonderful as well. it does not explain everything for you, but it withholds just enough information to make you think. with a unique and wonderful storyline, and excellent writing style, you can not go wrong when you decide to read dune.",TRUE

"very good and easy explanation of basic design principles, layout and typography, although i've not read the typography part. but after starting some small web site design, i was not able to easily color the site and saw the missing part in this book: colors!even the book is black-white only and most design people i have read starts by saying that first get it black-white and then color it, but still i wish it had colors as a part. actually third edition of this book contains a coloring part. so, you should buy the lastest edition. sadly, i haven't known this before buying this one.",TRUE

in this book shannon holmes writes it like a soap opera. it tells the life of many different people and in the end how they are all connected. if your not from the streets or don't know anything about the streets you have no right to say anything bad about this book especailly if you haven't went threw some of the things the females have went threw in this book. it's a must read hard to put down. it begins with the p-pound basically you could call them high class gold diggers but when the head of the p-pound gets a little to greedy and takes one of the men shes hustling money b/c she believes he'll rot in jail. things begin to go bad and as soon as life starts to look up. her past finally catches up with her and then she realizes she has to be more careful.,TRUE

"first of all, you cant deny that this is one of the best albums of the eighties. guns and roses were one of the few bands of the decade who played hard rock, but listening to it today is different. having grown up in the 90's it is easy to see how much of an eighties flavor this album has. it was all about excess. there are some points in the album where i ask myself, """"""""what is going on?"""""""" there seems to be about 200 guitar parts/solos, the drums are so loud and some of it seems just like noise. however, the album has it's bright points in """"""""sweet child of mine"""""""", """"""""welcome to the jungle"""""""", and a few others. while this album is hard rock all the way through, it ends on a bad note with , """"""""don't ever leave me, say you'll always be there,all i ever wanted was for you to know that i care"""""""" - an unfitting end to a hard album.",TRUE

"i've used these for about 4 years and i'm very happy with them. i can not understand why people would consistently choose something so much larger than these other than a lack of familiarity with this product and perhaps fear to go against the standard.the transmitter is so tiny and thus makes shooting remotely a pleasure.only downside is that i'm not crazy about large mono plug and needing tiny adaptors, but really no big deal. can be used in various guises as remote trigger for flash, studio lights, even camera.long battery life.why have some large unit on top of your camera when a tiny transmitter does the same?",TRUE

"granted, i liked this collection when it wad first released, but as is the case with all of grand funk's material, there does seem to be an aging process before it's true greatness is realized. it has become a standard for the gfr catalog. with a bounty of budget sized best of collections, the anthology stands tall as the best representation of the band i'm its prime, and in a time where fm radio is proving to be a general wasteland of pop music cast offs, re-discovering this funky, groovy, power pop group is more than refreshing. boasting crisp production and crisp remasteted sound, this is a perfect collection for the past, present, and future.",TRUE

"upon purchasing this system, i was a little skeptical of what it would sound like. i had never seen speakers with such a design and down-firing midranges. however, these speakers produce a great sound for the price. the bass is deep and clear, and the trebel, a bit tinny at times, is not overpowered by the lower ranges. the unique three way design of the satellite speakers provides great quality, and exceptional bass response for 3"""""""" speakers. great deal, you will not be disappointed.",TRUE

"this book is 800+ pages of a practical joke. it is very entertaining and well worth reading. it kept my attention throughout the story and i found myself laughing at the absurdities as well as the 'wink winks'. beyond that i would hope that people are intelligent and patient enough with the book to realize that it is a work of fiction, and that while there may be an iota of truth in every fifty pages, it is just a maybe. be sure to read after the story is completed, and you won't be disappointed. however if you're looking for a convenient linear storyline you definitely will be. one last note, this book has made me research more historical archives than any history class, any thing in life which makes you think is a great thing to experience.",TRUE

"this is my black lab's favorite toy. his first one lasted about a month in the house of constant play before it began to fall apart....then it became a backyard toy. otis is very picky about what kind of toy he will chase. most things tossed remain where they land. but toss this football and he will retrieve it and run around the yard like he's going for the touchdown. at this point, about 2 months after first purchased, it's split down the middle and barely holding together, but that makes no difference to otis....in fact, he prefers it in this floppy condition. we both love these footballs and wish that they were a bit sturdier, but i still think they make a great toy and are well worth the cost.",TRUE

"careers in criminal justice is a good starting point for those who are either considering or actively pursuing a career in law enforcement. stephens profiles a variety of careers such as chief of police, state attorney, small town and city police officers, fbi, forensics, and more. each profile centers on one officer, who explains how he or she became interested in their chosen field, the kinds of education they had to acquire both in school and on the job, and what traits an officer needs to possess in order to succeed. the most prevalent tip throughout the book was to gain a wide variety of education due to the growing cultural and technological trends in today's society.this book is a short 91 pages, and it doesn't list websites or professional organizations like several other books about law enforcement. but it is written in a conversational style, giving the reader a first-hand idea of what it is like to work out in the field or in a lab. recommended.",TRUE

i found william shaw's book fascinating when i first bought it back in 1999 and have recently gone back to it for some further insight on some complex problems in finance.it is a well-structured book that requires a basic understanding of both quantitative finance and mathematica before you can really get to grips with it but having said that the complexity that the author gets to is excellent.i would recommend this book to anyone in university studying for a quant-rlated finance masters or phd - and anyone practicing in the real world - this should be on your shelf alongisde your copy of mathematica.,TRUE

"""""""""it's a pleasure""""""""(rko, 1945)-------------------------------this is an unusually robust, earthy film for norwegian skating sensation sonia henie... her other films tended to be pretty goodie-two-shoesy, but this late wwii flick has a pretty salty script, apparently influenced by the hard-bitten film noir genre of the time. here, henie is a hardworking professional figure skater who falls for a hard-drinking, roughneck hockey player whose bad temper and alcoholism gets him banned from the sport (played by michael o'shea). he in turn is pursued by the trampy, sexually aggressive wife of one of his best friends, who plies him with booze and (apparently) leads him astray. the dialogue is full of both implied and surprisingly direct rawness -- hardly the family-friendly fare of henie's earlier films. all in all, pretty entertaining! you might be surprised at how racy the plot is... the skating's pretty fine, too!

"depressing as it is to agree with the kirkus review, i do. this is an elegant take on an uncomplicated, emotional story. a young man learns to forgive his parents their frailities and, in the process, understands his attraction to white chicks. a gutsy move for the author, since according to the jacket photo, he himself is a white guy, choosing to write from the point-of-view of a young japanese artist with a troubled family history. nonetheless, alan brown uses humor and beautiful descriptive sentences to make it work. does he stereotype the japanese? i think a more important question is: do we care about toshi or do we put the book down? i did... and i didn't. plus, the """"""""epilogue"""""""" is perfect.

for the reader interested in finding truth to historic myths about one of france's most famous queens look no further than this book. antonia fraser has constructed her information in such a way as to give life and feeling to marie antoinette throughout the many stages of her life. marie antoinette's personal experiences are told against the rich texture and detailed backdrop of france's political and cultural climate of the time period. this book is also an excellent in depth look into court nuances of versaille as well as their effect on france financially and culturally. antonia fraser has created probably the clearest window into marie antoinette as a woman in all her roles.,TRUE

"a slim paperback from pat barker. tightly written with believeable dialogue. it describes the yorkshire ripper crimes from the perspective of the women most affected, those working as prostitutes in the north of england. anyone familiar with this series of crimes will remember the shadow it cast over these english cities and the women who lived in them. pat barker's women jump off the page as genuine. her descriptions of domestic life could almost be described as lyrical if it wasn't for the tautness of her prose. the chapter written from the offenders point of view is perhaps the weakest part of what is a very strong short book. tight. succinct. probably a lesson in there for modern writers who often seem to use too many words to say too little. worth reading not only for the suspense in the plot but especially for the beauty and directness of the writing itself.",TRUE

"along with deep end and moonlighting, this is one of jerzy skolimowski's best films. starting with a cricket game at a british mental institution, it moves back in time to tell the story of a strange drifter, played by alan bates, who comes upon the home of a young couple. the wife, pretty susannah york, is intrigued with the handsome drifter; complications arise.but this is not the standard love triangle story at all. bates' character claims to have a bizarre ability which should not be revealed here--which he learned while adrift in the australian outback for several years. the final revelation of this ability and its consequences are a powerful climax to a riveting film that effectively puts the tale of the outsider in a startling context. the tension here is subtle and strong, giving this film a momentum that holds the viewer captive, just as bates' character himself holds the couple psychological captives.highly recommended; deserves much wider recognition.",TRUE

i've been meaning to get around to reading the tales of fahfrd and the grey mouser for some time now and i'm happy that i finally did. this first volume relates a couple of short stories about each character and how they came to leave home to see the larger world. the last part relates their meeting in lankhmar and an initial drunken and hysterical adventure together with ultimately more serious implications.both characters had their little quirks and i loved the interaction between them. the action was surprising and the magic (especially that of fahfrd's mother) was dark and fascinating. i need to get the next volume because it appears that the end of this one is only the beginning of a greater story.,TRUE

head was really the monkees at their last stage of fame until they had problems like the departure of peter tork and the decline of the album sales. but still head is a great movie with a psychedelic vibe running through the film. my favorite scene is mike's party mainly because it goes into a psychedelic party. also it tells four stories at once and has cameos from people you wouldn't expect to be in this film like frank zappa in one scene of the movie. this helps the movie become more fascinating especially if you know who the people that make the cameos are. head is not like most iconic films but it manages to become one . there's just a lot a fun parts in the movie and i would recommend this to any monkees fan. plus the soundtrack to this is really great.,TRUE

"the transylvanian composer bretan had one of the grimmer lives of any notable composer - his wife's family were murdered in auschwitz; his refusal in post-war romania to become a communist led to his silencing - but you wouldn't know it from either of these operas.they are serious and solemn enough. 'golem' takes the old story of a rampaging frankenstein-type monster and turns it into a melancholy dialogue about life, science, creation, family. 'arald', with its hero supplicating the seer of the underworld to resuscitate his dead love, forswears doomy gothic in favour of more metaphysical musings.from a dramatic point of view, both works are static. musically, however, they are gloriously reminiscent of mid-period verdi - bountifully melodic, rapturously sad - with an eastern european flavour. the fact that an opera composer in the mid-20th century dared even write a tune is reason enough to rejoice.",TRUE

"how can god be good if he allows something terrible to happen to good people? this is a question that was asked, but not fully answered in this mystery novel by terri blackstock. it is an unanswerable question, really.i did enjoy this novel. it was quick to read, and parts were extremely suspenseful. however, the police officer, cade, although likable seemed to be a bit slow on the uptake. i came to the conclusion that it would be extremely easy for anyone to be framed for commiting any kind of a crime in his town because he didn't seem to look far below the surface.the book reminded me of a """"""""jessica fletcher"""""""" kind of mystery with similar kinds of characters among the suspects and police officers. it had a christian/spiritual aspect that was quite interesting, particularly when you saw how one character's prayers when things seemed hopeless seemed to turn the tide.i'd like to read the remaining books in this series.",TRUE

"as other reviews mention, this is not a typical legal thriller. but then, scott turow is not a typical writer. his books do not follow any predictable formulas.wwii fiction is well trod ground, but ordinary heroes still gives some new perspectives. the characters are unique, flawed and interesting, and you care about what happens to them.i said scott turow does not follow formulas, and that is true, but if there is a common theme to his work, it is that all of his characters have secrets. the plot lines of the books are about how the secrets affect their lives, before and after they are revealed. the characters are well drawn, and he shows you how the story affects all of them, for better or worse.why not five stars? too many typos in the kindle version. well worth the time to read, anyway.",TRUE

"this is a compelling page-turner that will keep you up at night. if you enjoy cold-war thrillers, robert harris has figured out how to bring them back to life in this post cold-war era. this book has an outstanding plot tied to a secret notebook that was supposedly stolen from stalin on the day that he died. from the moment we learn of this missing notebook (on about page 2) through to the last page, harris takes us on a wild ride from moscow through the northern reaches of what used to be know as the soviet union. the story never slows.harris is a masterful fiction writer. he uses words that paint pictures so vivid that we feel we are with the characters. he weaves historical facts into a wonderful tale that had me reading every free minute over the course of three days. if you are looking for an exciting piece of fiction, don't miss adding this book to your reading list.",TRUE

this animation is a strange anime for several reasons. firstly the animation is up to the standard of some manga productions. it is clear and well realised. the story is strong in that the villan is far more interesting than the heroine. iria is a bounty hunter who is caught up in tracking the creature 'zieram'. there follows a complicated tale of her adventures that are frequently inter-spersed with flashbacks. however the real star of the show is zieram who proves more than a match for anything that it comes up against (it absorbs there dna thus making itself stronger). the music is good and the dubbing is fair. overall it should appeal to science fiction fans as well as those who enjoy a blockbuster type animation.,TRUE

"since this recording was issued over ten years ago, it has been among the highly regarded recordings of der rosenkavalier. the casting is ideal. kiri te kanawa as the marschellin, anne-sophie von otter as octavian and barbara hendricks as sophie. the voices of all three are beautifully suited to their roles, and they blend together so well in the third act trio. richard leech is perfect in the cameo role of the tenor and kurt rydl makes a suitably boorish baron ochs. the orchestral playing and balance with the voices could not be better. bernard haitink does a fabulous job and the staatskapelle perform with passion.in short, this is a recording of der rosenkavalier that competes with the best. lovers of this opera will not be disappointed.",TRUE

this amazing book written by john strege should be read by all young golfers. this book tells about how tiger and his family have to live through the struggles of racism and how tiger prevails over other golfers. tiger is an ordinary boy growing up except that he's black. at 5 years old tiger was playing exceptional golf. tiger travels all around the u.s.a. to play in golf tournaments and only gets better along the way. the theme is about tiger going from good to great. i loved this story because of all the suspense that builds up and how tiger achieved greatness in the golf world.,TRUE
"while i didn't feel that this novel met the standard ms. roberts set with her previous two trilogies, i still thoroughly enjoyed reading it. the setting and characters were well-drawn (except, perhaps, for evan, who struck me as slightly one-dimensional), and i kept turning the pages because i truly cared about what happened to nell, zach, mia, and ripley. adding in the magic kept it from being a rehash of previous storylines. i recommend this to anyone looking for a good story about love, magic, witches, strong women... basically, just about anyone. :-)",TRUE

"i still talk about this soundtrack album a good 13 years later. i've already worn out the original cd i bought in '91 and i'm trying to get another one. this one was loaded with funky new jack swing numbers like christopher williams,f.s. effect, guy (too funky), color me badd's bass heavy track, underrated danny madden's facts of love, ice-t's aggressive new jack hustler and others! the ballads are nice--johnny gill's ballad gives keith sweat's some stiff competition! 2 live crew's somber, message-driven in the dust is a smart alternative to their sex-driven songs. and the surprise here was the troop/levert/queen latifah song for the love of money, a strong mix of soulful r&b and the queen's no-nonsense hip-hop style. this really was a hot song using the rap/r&b collaboration style that beyonce, christina aguilera, ja rule, ashanti and a number of artists use today! phenomenal soundtrack with some gritty,urban, hard hitting beats and rhythms!",TRUE
"before there was harry potter, there was harvey potter, gentleman balloon farmer. jerdine nolen's story is fun and plays off a child's natural curiosity. the story is great--a little girl spies on the farmer of a balloon farm to figure out exactly how he grows those balloons (and, of course, it turns out that he uses good old-fashioned magic). but what really makes this book a stand-out are mark buehner's superb illustrations. slyly employing a style and upright look that recalls both grant wood and edward hopper, buehner turns the volume up by using super-saturated colors--perfect for a book about magic and balloons. there is almost more humor and wonder in the pictures than in the text. i highly recommend this book, especially for budding artists. the pictures are just a joy to gaze upon and enjoy.",TRUE

"i think game gear is the best hand held system invented. unlike the game boy you can see the screen even in the dark, it doesn't matter if you have the light for game boy(color/advanced) the picture is still horrible. game gear's screen reminds me of a t.v. screen because you are able to see in the dark with out a stupid little light attachment. when i was about 7 my mom bought one for my brother and i, and we have had it for about 9 years now and they are still running perfectly, they were perfect for us because we use to bring them with us in the car and on planes and they made time fly by. some disadvantages to it would be that it is a little larger for a hand held game and it does tend to eat up 6aa batteries but if you buy the adaptor than it is no problem to use, and since it is a older system it doesn't have new games like the newer system but for the games made for the system i think they are really good.",TRUE

"my copy is the one dog-eared, worn volume always where i can find it on the bookshelf. usually poetry volumes contain some winners and some losers, but i've read every poem cover to cover repeatedly, had favorites, sent copies to women who inspired me, and loved my copy in some rough times. piercy's poems raise the bar for what women can be in poetry- hers are real- warts and all. and nevertheless, her first-person poetry makes those flaws both recognizable and even at times endearing. the tragedies are laced with revelation, the lovers are never perfect, and even piercy's piece devoted to lost luggage evokes those little moments which become laughable and yet epic in their betrayal.",TRUE
"this book is the testament of a determined person who has raised the consciousness of a parish. he along with others refused to be refused a right that many of us take for granted today. from the scott scholarship to the visits cleo brown makes to louisiana (thank you tallulah for bringing her october 2003!), john h. scott lives on. his words ring out pride in yourself and hope for your community. i am challenged to not let his and others' efforts go in vain. this book, which certainly has a place in (a certain book club), should be read by every student in the delta area. they should know that great people can come from humble beginnings. thank you john h. scott memorial fund for helping me through school and thank you cleo brown for compiling this book to help me through life.",TRUE
this is the book i've needed for so long. i like that each lesson takes you several different books of the bible to find answers to the questions. there is also a discussion section after the answer page to help you understand the meaning. i would recommend this to anyone at any level that wants to study the bible.,TRUE
"it's a redwall book. need i say more? just like the others, this book is excellent, and even in the beginning, it has you caring for the characters or (or in the villainess queen tsarmina's case) loathing them. this book keeps you wanting more, and with it's size bigger than usual books, gives exactly that. out of 5 stars i give it 10! be sure to check out the other redwall books also! you won't be disapointed!",TRUE
"like every case i have ever used, the belt clip is rather flimsy (i blame my studded leather belt for this problem). also, the screen protector can be difficult to put in. other than that, this is an absolutely great case. aside from the jack for the headphones, it provides protection to the entire ipod (screen, wheel, body, and even the 30 pin connection on the bottom). the screen cover takes away a little of the brightness, but somehow makes it look clearer at the same time because it hides the scratches it accumulated prior to this wonderful case.",TRUE

"absolutely great album. short, fast, and humorous. keith morris's social commentaries, backed with an alarmingly tight and fast band make this one of the best hardcore albums ever! they kinda went downhill after this, in my opinion. the last song, """"""""group sex"""""""" is hilarious (and co-written by jeffrey lee pierce of the gun club). in it morris reads off a phone number for the infamous residence that hosted sex parties in the 70s. well, one night about 15 years ago i called the number and spoke to a woman who knew excatly why i called. she said many people had called her over the years, but were disappointed to find out that the phone number belonged to someone else now and that she didn't host these parties!",TRUE
"i really like the sound of this band ever since i saw them perform on a late show one night. i really do think they sound better live, since the album is a little too mellow and restrained for my taste, but good and relaxing nonetheless. ignore the people who are on here saying he is a no talent - since they must have no appreciation for real talent, and must be too used to all the crap they play in between commericals on american radio stations these days. the damien rice band is very talented, and it seems to me it is only a matter of time before they go mainstream, and are doing international tours.",TRUE

"let me say i have never heard of this band until two weeks ago, and let me say i have been pleasantly surprised. theyhave the charm and wit of jonathan richman, and a playful way of music much like the elephant 6 bands. the songs here are a whole lot of fun and charming.... i heard that they had another album in the can after this one that showed a progression in their music, too bad alex had to skip town and leave it in record limbo, i hope someday their follow-up will be ressurected and pianosaurus can be realized for the ididot savant genius. find this album!",TRUE

"this remake of shakespeare's play keeps alive the the flavor of the orignal play. i've always enjoyed shakespeare's comedies, and this remake doesn't disappoint. the puns and banter of the characters are fresh and entertaining. at times, some of the actors show their inexperience (this is particularly true of heath ledger). julia stiles does a superb job of playing the shrew. in fact, she steals the show. my other favorite character is ms. perky, the sex-obsessed guidance counselor. after you've had one of those days when nothing seems to go right, pop this movie in the dvd player and get ready to laugh!",TRUE
the author was able to show some of the very interesting conversations and logic that went on behind closed doors. this was the star of the book. only thing keeping this from a five star is that the last third of the book lost a lot of energy.,TRUE

"the truth is, this book really wasn't on par with the preceeding books of the series plot wise, but in truth, this book is the true turning of anita's morals. before she was wondering if she was just one of the monsters and in this book, she begins to accept it, as well as accepting that some of her infamous rules are pointless. it is fascinating to see just how exactly someone's mind can go from so high on the moral podium to having nearly no lines anymore and this book accuratly shows the mental process of that degration.this book also back tracked a little by pointing out that vampires, while looking like humans and thinking like humans most of the time, are not, in fact, human.sure there's lots and lots of sex (depends, really, on whether you like that kind of thing or not) but most of that really just helps show how anita is beginning to accept herself and those around her as well as the situation in life she had been thrown.",TRUE
"this is their best album!! the music is amazing!! it is completely underrated and has passed many radio stations that it even exists as none of it's music gets played on the radio. it is proof that a major international rock act throughout the world and u.s.

"after learning in a science class about dr. rife's experiment and his subsequent banning, this book is his vindication. remember, the ama discredited chiropractic healing and acupuncture, too, which have finally become mainstream. the ama now hangs on to its last and greatest bastion of power and profitability by discrediting any cancer treatment other than its own. remember, these new methods were not created by snake-oil salesmen in crude labs: these discoveries were made by men of science after many years of ethical trials. i can only speak for the merits of protocel and cancell: i have not fully studied the other methods. given the choice between chemotherapy and radiation, i know what i would do.ms pierce writes a compelling and informative case for alternative cancer treatments in a thoroughly readable manner. i'm waiting for the ama to ban her, too.",TRUE

"i've never owned a juice extrator before, and have only used this one once now, but i'm really happy with it. it does a very good job of extracting the juice. the juice to food ratio was a lot better than i thought it would be and the remaining solids have about the consistency of cookie dough. the only thing i don't like is that it kind of spits at you a little everytime you take the handle out to add more fruit or vegetables. not very much, but you don't want to get any little dots of beets on your shirt. i don't know if other juicers do this, but i'm guessing thats the price you pay for getting the big mouth. we just threw a bunch of stuff in there that we had in the fridge: beets, kiwi, apples, pears, oranges, carrots, celery, then taste it and a little more sweet fruits, or a little more lemon and vegetables for tartness to get the taste right.",TRUE

"i was utterly amazed when i first learned that the u.s. drafted some of the very same japanese-american men that the government interned on suspicion of disloyalty during world war ii. i was further amazed when i learned that the government criminally prosecuted those among them who resisted the draft. this book tells this incredible story with balance, grace, and insight. the pages pull you along as you quickly get wrapped up in the lives of the resisters and those in the government and in their own ethnic community who opposed them. the highpoint of the book for me was muller's account of the one resisters' trial that did not result in convictions. a lone federal district court judge bucked the government and dismissed the charges on the grounds that they offended basic notions of due process. this last story is a """"""""profile in courage"""""""" particularly appropriate to our current circumstances. read this book.",TRUE

"swat 3 has great gameplay, combined with good controls and a realistic ai. also worth noting is that the ai enemies are placed in random locations throughout the maps, allowing for more interesting replays of missions (the bad guys aren't always in the same spot!).another thing that's worth noting is that the game will run on almost any system (celeron processor? no problem!). i've personally observed it running at fast rates on fairly old computers that have celeron processors.the only downside to the game is its infamous last mission. the last mission tries to force the player to move quickly through the map (due to a timer), in a failed attempt to delay the time that it takes for someone to complete the game. this only results in the last mission not encouraging the player traits that are so heavily encouraged in previous missions: patience and strategy.over all, though, it's a great game. i recommend that you buy it.",TRUE

works great! i ordered this item to change the oil in my wife's new volvo and avoid the hassle of having to crawl under the car (it has a top mounted oil filter). the mityvac arrived promptly with no damage; the directions were well written; and within an hour i was changing oil. about 5 pumps removed half the oil and another 5 pumps finished the process. the unit is simple but very well made and a genuine bargain at amazon's price (with free shipping). the dealer wanted $150 for the 15k service. i completed the job in 30 minutes and barely got my hands dirty. thanks amazon!,TRUE

for the money you can't beat it but if you're a die hard fan you might be let down by the lack of extras. only two of the many psas are included and it is the same way with the original toy commercials. the remastering makes it look better than it did when i watched it during the original broadcasts. i believe there were also some cast interviews included in another set that aren't in this one which is a disappointment. still it's the best deal so far for the entire g1 us line. i hope they release more japanese series from this company in the future.,TRUE

adams always is a delight to read. while adams is not perfect he is passionate about the right things and hits the nail on the head on almost every issue. he blazed the trail for modern noutetic counseling. those who have expressed problems with this book do not have the high view of scripture that adams holds and do not understand the depravity of man as the bible teaches. they also do not understand how the presuppostions of psychology are anti-christian and they do not bring glory to god. this is a very practical book that is a good read for all christians who seek to restore their bretheren (gal. 6),TRUE

"i've just finished reading this book and so it's all still very fresh in my mind. i know that i was supposed to root for the english, but the author made the german spy, die nadel, so appealing that i found myself rooting for him and hoping that he'd at least make it out alive, even if his mission ultimately fails (which i knew would happen, of course, from knowing the history of the wwii).the german spy is a loner, he is mistrustful and relies on logic, not emotion. he is an attractive man, an intelligent and educated german aristocrat, and he calculates his moves with military precision.on the other hand, the english forces trying to capture him are portrayed as mostly bumbling idiots, always a day late and a dollar short. i couldn't muster an ounce of sympathy for percy or bloggs.the subplot (lucy and david on the island) was suspenseful and added a dimension to the story.",TRUE

"the rifle, gary paulsen is a good book for people who like to read stories that have to do with history and some action. this book starts off in the 17th century with a thirty-five year old man, cornish mcmanus, an apprentice to a gunsmith named john waynewrite, who grew up to be one of the best gunsmiths in the western pennsylvania region. the book is called the rifle because he makes a rifle but it's not a normal rifle; it's a very special rifle with the accuracy of a modern day sniper rifle. this rifle gets passed down generation to generation until one night when something goes horribly wrong.the plot of this book follows the rifle throughout its time being passed down from generation to generation from the 17th century to the 19th century. this book would be a good story for the summer or a long car trip. over all it was a good book because the history of the rifle was interesting.",TRUE

"we got two remote control cars for our 3.5-year-old twins this christmas, and someone else (coincidentally) got them another two. this one was, by far, the easiest to operate. the other ones caused a bit of frustration for them (though they still enjoy them-- and i should concded that those other ones were rated for kids 5 and up or so). but this one was really easy for them to use from the start, and yet doesn't really seem less functional or particularly more baby-ish or anything.only downside is that you can't choose it's channel, so if you have multiple rc cars going at once, they might end up getting controlled by other controllers. my kids generally find this amusing, though, so not a big problem. and the advantage of having one pre-set channel is that there are no problems with channel on remote and on car getting out of sync, which does cause confusion for the cars we have that have variable channel choices.",TRUE

"this is one of the most exciting and emotional rock albums to come around in quite a while.comparisons to other bands based on specific sounds (including the singer's voice), are superficial. there is rock-solid pop songwriting at work here. and the songs have an exciting and urgent emotional tone. this arresting combination of strong songwriting and powerful emotion is what distinguishes arcade fire from their peers.",TRUE

"a surprisingly watchable documentary. christie is the audrey hepburn of supermodels, with all the graciousness and class and poise that hepburn had, and so is a treat to watch move and talk and walk in catwalk. when you have big-headed, sometimes nasty supermodels like linda evangelista and naomi campbell annoying the public, it's nice to have a kind christie turlington to prove that just because you're beautiful doesn't mean you can't be humble. it's a shame that christie was diagnosed with emphysema at age 31. she said smoking cigarettes from aged 13 to 26 is probably what brought it on. it's hard to have much sympathy for the rich, famous and beautiful, but my heart does go out to christie because she seems such a lovely, lovely person in every way, as catwalk shows.",TRUE

weapons of the spirit is the story of a small french town that saved at least 3000 jews during the second world war. their history as a heugenot (protestant) community that had endured centuries of persecution and their reverence for the people of the old testament (the jews) combined with their strong sense of justice made them just naturally protect the most vulnerable at great risk to themselves. the video asks relevant questions for today. who will stand up for the most vulnerable today? what makes one group put themselves on the line for those that do not belong to 'their people' and what makes other groups take the easy way of going along with authority even when the authority is wrong?,TRUE

"one at a time sends a powerful message through the stories of individual animals who are homeless and in crisis. it is the finest example i have ever read on the topic of unwanted/homeless animals in our society and the shelters that accept all dogs and cats brought to their doors. each animal's story and accompaning photograph provides a greater understanding of why millions of wonderful dogs and cats become homeless. in addition, one at a time gives us hope by empowering individuals to facilitate change through simple acts of responsibity and kindness.if every petlover (who in the past purchased a dog or cat) read one at a time, their next opportunity to obtain a pet would result in a visit to their local shelter. everyone who has an interest in animals, including breeders, no-kill advoctes, and public officials, will gain a greater understanding of the life saving services shelters provide.",TRUE

i purchased two pairs of the sennheiser rs120 926mhz wireless rf headphones with charging cradle. the headphones are used for television viewing so i cannot say how well they work when leaving the living room. they were purchased for my father and my husband. my husband often wakes up in the wee hours of the morning and watches television. the headphones are a blessing because they allow him to view and hear the televison without disrupting the rest of the sleeping household. my father had trouble hearing the televison clearly and the headphones allow him to adjust the volume to his personal needs without having the t.v. volume too loud for everyone else in the room. the headphones are adjustable and comfortable. the sound quality is clear. they were easy to set up and use right out of the box (right after i charged the batteries). the sets came with rechargeable batteries and the charging cradle. it's a wonderful product and i would purchase it again.,TRUE

"a no-nonsense citizen ecodrive -- exactly what i was looking for. after destroying yet another watch trying to change the battery, i decided to spend a little bit extra and get an ecodrive that i've read so much about. i didn't want (or need) a chronograph, just something that would give me the time and date. this watch is simple and looks good. the band was a bit stiff for the first couple of days, but it has loosened up nicely. as many (many) people before me have stated, the band is a matter of choice on whether you keep it or change it out. i like the band for now, it seems like it's very durable but i can see myself wanting to change it for a leather strap sometime in the future. extremely pleased with my purchase.",TRUE

"surely this is a patent infringement of some sort but the price of these kits is a fraction of the cost of geomags which are made in switzerland. i've purchased and tested every variation of magnetic building sets available and geomag is clearly the cream of the crop by a mile. therefore, i was really surprised that these are indistinguishable from geomag (same size balls, same length sticks, same earth magnets, same magnetic strength, except the sticks don't have geomag on them). on the down side, after ordering a bunch of them and getting stuck with a $125+ shipping fee (yes, they are heavy, but...), i realized the distributor was in another chicago suburb -- it would have been nice to have gotten a call as i would have happily driven to pick them up rather than paid this kind of money for shipping.",TRUE

this is just a quick note. i live in atlanta in a large house. it is costly to turn the central heat on just to take the chill off a couple of rooms when if you wait long enough it generally will warm up. i have used holems quartz heaters for several years moving them around as needed. the current model sold here in 2007 is much improved over the ones sold back before 2005. one nice feature is that they include a circuit breaker in a module at the plug end. you can tap that switch to instantly turn one off rather then step through all the different settings using the top mounted switch. i am here checking the current price as i intend to buy a coouple of more of these so they don't need to be moved around. these are really nice space heaters compared to the junk i have tried over the years. they hold up even in the humid enviroment of the bath.i highly recomend this item.,TRUE

"i really enjoyed this movie. altogether, it's not bad -- nowhere half as bad as some people claim. very interesting version of """"""""the prince and the pauper"""""""", with a modern new york city twist. it's cool to see janine and alex try to live each other's lives, which produces very entertaining results. it's especially cool to see justin timberlake in there. i sure wish they had given him more screen time, but then again, he's not the central character.if you haven't seen this movie yet, i recommend that you do. i know a lot of people think this is a crummy movie, but hey, not everyone likes the same things. we all have different tastes. we all have our likes, and our dislikes. i suggest you watch this movie (all the way) at least once before you make your final opinion.",TRUE
"as a great coward fan, i was slightly disappointed with this cd for two reasons. firstly, there are a lot of songs on it which are not sung by noel coward himself but by various of his female musical associates. the quality of these tracks is rather patchy and the words, so vital to an appreciation of coward's talent, are frequently inaudible, in particular in the wonderful song, 'i went to a marvellous party'. secondly, 'mad dogs and englishmen', undoubtedly the most famous of coward's songs, has been edited in order to make it more politically correct by omitting the 'wogga wogga' sounds that natives in africa are said by coward to make. coward belongs to a period of jingoistic colonialism and imperialism; attempting to dilute that by editorial intervention is unwarranted revisionism.apart from these two criticisms, the cd offers a good sample of coward's work.",TRUE

"being my first vampire novel, the historian was a perfect read for me as the subject is not just the dracula character and more about period history as the title. it is truly a journey with the main characters involved in an elaborate chase more like the da vinci code. the impaler makes enough appearances to entice and therefore the novel doesn't get all gore and science fictionary. a nice story about a father telling and showing his daughter through their vacation travels and their love of books their family's origins and helping her learn about her mother. reading this world was fun and enlightening for me. bordering on a 3.5 stars for me as novel because it starts slowly but has fast moments. prose is wonderful!",TRUE

"the opteka battery grip looks and works exactly like the hoodman, which sells for $100 more. the only advantage is that hoodman offers a pricey modification allowing use of the vertical shutter release without the cumbersome infrared cable (which is pretty much useless). the grip serves two useful purposes: it doubles battery capacity, which means that you can shoot heavily all day without recharging, and - most importantly to me - it offers a larger grip space and balances the camera when used with longish lenses like the 80-200 or 70-200 zooms, or the 300 f4. also, it's lightweight. the lack of a vertical shutter release is a drawback, but as another reviewer wrote, that's really nikon's fault. all in all, the opteka grip does what it's supposed to do at a good price.",TRUE

"lester has done a good job of identifying the issues that face us both now and in the future, especially in the area of globalization and the global economy. where his arguments break down are in the solutions. lester tends to prescribe government intervention to resolve the issues, rather than letting the free market play a role in resolving the issues. my impression is that he believes that both the europeans and the japanese have superior systems, and that we should copy what they have been doing, which involves a lot of government money and buraucracy. the book is certainly good reading up to the last few chapters, when the government solutions start to creep in. contrast thurow to peter drucker, who depends more on better business practices to enable companies to compete globally",TRUE

"precious bane is an incredibly rich, lovely story, told in a manner that seems almost faerie-like, though incisively real in its depiction of human nature. it's about a young woman born with a hare-lip in 19th-century rural england, and how she comes to win (and be won by) the fine young man who is the desire of her heart.it's a great book for teens because, among other elements in its complex theme, it is concerned with true feminine beauty, which resides in purity and virtue.the story is moving, and lingers long after the book is through. definitely one you'll keep in your mind's collection.",TRUE

"except for a few tracks, this album is pure genius.the first track, sunset, is a good introduction to the kind of music you'll be hearing in the rest of the cd. a mixture of english and hindi-dialect vocals, it is both beautiful and relaxing.track 8, breathing light is my favorite track, mixing together violins, piano and fast-paced rhythms. i haven't met anyone who did not like this song.track 15, prophesy is a pseudo-tribal rhythm that starts slow and picks up with detailed vocals that accompany the even-more-detailed instruments. the pace at which the background singers chant at the end is incredible, almost too fast too pick up. listen carefully.",TRUE

"great novel for first time novelist matthew bracken. i would have found it more entertaining if not for the fact that, though """"""""enemies foreign and domestic"""""""" is a work of fiction, i can't help the feeling that i'm reviewing future history, and this work is an omen of wicked events to come. for all it's worth people in bracken's novel are completely convinicing (both the """"""""good guys"""""""" and the """"""""bad guys"""""""") and have the same strengths and weaknessess that everybody has. regardless of how some feel about these issues, bracken makes his point that everybody had better be prepared or suffer the fate of countless victims throughout history.",TRUE
the collection of songs on this new marshall crenshaw album are maybe his best - catchy and melodic but mostly midtempo. this new album may be too subtle and sophisticated for the average listner who was attracted to the uptempo power pop of this fine artist's earlier albums. give this album a listen. these new songs could have easily been played uptempo with power chords emphasized in the chorus and that crowd would have been happy with another repeat. these songs are even more melodic than crenshaw's great tunes of the past. they are just played midtempo. instead of his usual power chords crenshaw substitutes richer instrumentation in the album's production. i wish when artists grow in a positive new way fans could grow too.,TRUE

story - 3 starsart - 4 starsmessage - 5 starsand the message is what makes this such a wonderful children's book. the story itself isn't exceptional -- it is about a daddy/daughter day spent together (with the family dog) doing nothing special. but the watercolor art is cute and well rendered by ms. julia douglas and the message that spending time together is the most special thing of all tugs at the heart strings. i read this to my four year old and she was hugging and cuddling up to me before i was halfway through it. that alone is worth the price of the book! i think i'll find myself reaching for this one whenever i want to connect with my girl in that special way on daddies and daughters can.,TRUE

"this book blew me away many times. some descriptions are off the charts, his writing skill is unquestionable. i got muddled down in the format of having so many characters tell the story from their own povs. eventually they began to sound like the same person, which maybe was the goal, but it didn't pay off. also, i never felt any conflict. the characters were successful at whatever they did, no one failed miserably. it was like the first act of a julia roberts movie. everyone is a gorgeous doctor millionaire and war hero. i guess you could say it was fluffy, but that's the formula for romance movies, which may have been the goal.",TRUE

i should be able to put 0 stars . i have heard songs off this album i must say scott is right when her says it sounds just like creed. this album is awful like all the creed material. i just read an interview where he compared his leaving creed to when sting left the police. come on! that was the problem creed had in the first place they are horrible but believe themselves to be some kind of great artists. this guy is the farthest thing from an original artist i have seen since milli vanilli. this record is awful!!! scoot stapp is awful and anyone who bought a creed album should buy this because they have absolutely no sense of being a creative artist. he will probably be played on clear channel radio stations alot which is appropriate since they are awful too. i would write more but that would mean i care. i don't i have hated this guy from the beginning and for him to compare himself to sting just went over the line. i mean creed was nothing compared to the artistry of the police.,FALSE

we own a majority of the wiggle's collection and this is the first time we were truely disappointed. the cd is just over 36 minutes long and a good part of it is insturmental. so much for sing-a-longs in the car. my two year old son enjoys singing with them not with instuments. he'll even tell you to go to the next song until you get to them singing. eariler works have proven to be much more enjoyable for our family. i really felt like this cd was not up to the quailty of the wiggles past work.,FALSE

"i love gwyneth paltrow and i love the movies. i am not a picky movie person. i can watch just about anything and have seen some low budget paltrow movies that i thoroughly enjoyed. but, this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the plot was severely lacking and the acting was unenjoyable. most of the movie consisted of paltrow's character (katie) bickering with another actor/actress. not even worth the watch.",FALSE

i bought this thinking it was similar to netgear xavb101 powerline av ethernet adapter kit and boy was i in for a surprise. the description for the product is misleading and will make you think its similar to all the other power line adapters when its completely not. you can't use anything else besides d-link's products in order for it to work and you have to use their router in order to power up one of the adapter. if your looking for a cheap power line ethernet this definitely not the one for you.,FALSE

"i bought mine after suddenly needing my desktop to be wireless instead of wired after a move. thinking getting this netgear product for under $10 (from another site) would solve my issues well enough was a huge mistake, giant headache, and general waste of time.after installing in windows xp, the adaptor will work for about 2 hours, decide to shut it self down, and cease to work with my computer unless i re-install the drivers.while it does manage to work i get download speeds of about 20kbps whereas everyone's laptop on the same router easily gets 150kbps. for a wireless-g product this is absolutely unacceptable.considering i only paid $10 for my headache i can't imagine paying $50-90 as listed here. do yourself a favor and get a pci based wireless card instead. they're cheaper even.",FALSE
"length:: 0:34 minssorry about the sound - this vacuum has a horrible screeching sound to it -- but i wanted it to be clear that the vacuum was on.this is the worst vacuum i have ever used. the little hand-held, battery operated dirt devil i used to clean out my first car was light years better. the vacuum does not pick anything up. period. not on hard wood and not on rugs. you have to see it to believe how bad it is. it blows things like cereal flakes and other crusty stuff around, and it just moves fuzzies around. i would never, ever, ever recommend this to anyone. i want to give it away to someone, but it's not worth anyone's time to pick up.i can't believe things like this are still even made.",FALSE
"the writing is smooth, relaxing guterson, but the story falls far short of """"""""snow falling.."""""""" way too much description of the country and landscape around wenatchee. in a story of peregrinations, the author can confuse the reader by so many places where things take place. the theme, a man intending suicide, has his mind changed by events, a good one, and effective here. but i thought the book tended to be too padded with travelogue, names of rivers, highways, etc.",FALSE
"i am an avid nip/tuck fan and have all the seasons on dvd. i have been really sad that this will be the last season, but after seeing the season premiere, it might be for the best. this was the worse nip/tuck episode i have ever seen. who is this evil liz and these old, tired, worn out doctors? who is this new actress playing teddy? why does teddy's character go from a mysterious wild child to a woman who wears $150,000 earrings?this episode had hardly any substance... just smidgens of christian and liz fighting, sean having trouble sleeping, matt not knowing what he wants to do with his life, etc. the tiny bit of drama with sean and sleeping pills in the last fifteen seconds is nothing compared to kimber being kidnapped by the carver, matt finding out ava was a man, or gina being f***ed off a balcony.this episode was nothing like nip/tuck normally is, and this time it was not a good thing. i'll watch the whole season, but here's hoping it gets better from here on out.",FALSE
"i was disappointed in this work. to me, nin earlier work, """"""""and all that could have been"""""""" live concert on dvd was much better. that said, it's still pretty good. i would have given it three stars, but they also had to throw in some political innuendo, which is a huge turnoff for me.",FALSE

worst phone i ever bought. wish i had read the reviews. constantly losing its security code so you can't dial out on it.,FALSE
"what's the point of this. they could have released all the movies including the rarer """"""""get out of my room"""""""" in one set. they instead pick the classic """"""""up in smoke"""""""" which has already got a lot of extras, and probably their worst movie (debatable with """"""""corsican brothers"""""""") and certainly least funny. that dvd had no extras, and there isn't any extras advertised on the front, so i'm asuming there aren't any. this also leaves the door open to more sets, possibly a """"""""nice dreams"""""""" and """"""""next movie"""""""" combo, which we don't need either. the """"""""up in smoke"""""""" movie raises it to 2 stars which is as high as it will go.",FALSE

"this album features some great music from an extraordinary band... unfortunately it suffers from terrible remastering. straying far from big country's trademark bass-heavy, echoey, drum-heavy mix (listen to the crossing & seer), the engineer on this reissue leans more for a brittle, clean, dry, highly treble sound that is altogether displeasing & far from big country's original vision. i recommend instead purchasing the reissue of """"""""the crossing"""""""" which has been masterfully remastered and includes several stunning bonus tracks that date from big country's early & most prolific era!",FALSE

i ordered a replacement. but this first shredder was completely dead on arrival. plugged it in and nothing. also there were a lot of finger prints on the metal sensor guard and fine scratches like this had been used before. is fellowes selling refurbished units as new?! this better stop if it's the case. also my ac plug had on of the prongs slightly bent and the rubber piece where the basket sits had come off already in the box. the box was pretty banged up too when it arrived. here's to hoping my replacement will work like it's supposed to.,FALSE
