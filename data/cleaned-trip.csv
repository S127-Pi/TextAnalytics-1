"8","great dealgreat deal, booked a very last minute flight (travelling the next day) from thailand to london via china. using 2 different airlines, sichuan airlines & air china. got a great price and e tickets for the 2 airlines sent by email. checking in was easy and i didnt have to collect my baggage and recheck in as the airline sichuan airlines took care of that for me. what i will say is do not buy any liquids ie alcohol in thailand as once you go through passport control again in chengu airport they take the liquids off of you even if sealed in a duty free bag, any liquids even under 100ml. i have now downloaded the app and will definitely be using trip.com again and will also recommend it to my daughter who is going travelling next month and her friends. plus you collect coins with every purchase to give you money off your next booking. especially when travelling, every little helps!

"83","would never use this company ever againim surprised, shocked, and horrified to say the least. i did not expect such a sour experience with this company. i did my research, looked at the reviews and thought that this was a booking agency i could trust. their prices seemed too good to be true but naively, trustingly, i bought a $700 return ticket through them. upon issues with check in, the company was an absolute sheeeeet show of help (put nicely) and then refused a refund, to change my flight, or offer any real advice. the flight was purchased on behalf of my partner who needed to renew a visa asap so rebooking a flight within a 24 hour period (and no later) was non negotiable for me. i was offered 5,000 fly points as some sort of consolation, amounting to $50. kind of pathetic when i spent $700 and invested my faith, but hey, i decided i would use this company once more as im a believer in second chances and did feel as if they were trying to help.lo and behold i spent multiple hours trying to purchase a new ticket with my flight points, only to find no option to apply them. i tried on my phone. on my laptop. i installed the app. i verified my account multiple times. i rang customer service five times. i spent the rest of my day in a confused rage trying to use a bugged, glitched website, being talked to by a different representative. being offered patronising comments and no solution. this company has enough money to have a fully functioning server and website, yet they do not? so where do the funds for their business venture go?to gift me flight points that cannot be used ooooof what an absolute joke.the most i got was our tech team will review this within 72 hours but by 72 hours my desired flight would have long gone and my partner would have gone into overstaying, breaching the terms of his visa.we can offer you more flight points your server is having an issue where im not able to pay via credit card, paypal or anything other than debit card let alone select my flight points. thats like offering me an expired coupon. its completely useless. and you best believe i sent screenshots from laptop and phone which were just ignored. honestly they treated me like i didnt know how to use the internet, despite being a frequent traveller and well versed in technology, this company took no responsibility. despite being honest. patient. and even trusting of the customer service team. i have come out of this experience feeling bitter, belittled and would caution anyone wanting a safe, comfortable travel to use any of the other hundreds of companies available. this one is not worth the risk unfortunately and 99% sure they buy off their reviews instead of investing into a worthwhile business.",1

"173","incompetent, disinterested, disorganized: save your money and book with someone else!two refunds from this company have gone missing. trying to get more details about these refunds (transaction numbers, refund mode, payment processor, etc.) has been like pulling teeth. each time, they repeat the same spiel over and over, and tell you to go to the bank with the same info they're not giving you. you're always attended to by someone with a different name, too, so you're totally guaranteed of reasonable follow ups to your case.to make matters worse, despite multiple instructions to correspond with the owner of the account only, they keep harassing the passenger named on the booking, who has had no part in the transaction and is also now subjected to this pathetic show of customer service, primarily through the farce of multiple emails sent to their account with more or less the same message each time.update: following this review, they are now harassing me on my mobile phone at 8:30 in the evening, despite explicit instructions not to contact me unless they've made substantive progress on my case, and by email to a designated account only. i'm clearly dealing with a steaming sewer of ineptitude and complete disregard over here.further update: it turns out that trip.com has opened multiple cases for my problem, resulting in further harassment of the passenger and evidently, crossed wires. rachel clearly didn't get the memo that trip.com's customer success team has dealt with, and resolved my case, earlier this week (following much gaslighting and unreasonable requests though, i regret to add).again, the lack of competence and basic communication shown here isn't exactly confidence boosting. and no amount of claims that i failed to communicate with you on this matter will convince me to either remove or modify my rating at this point, because this has been a truly, truly awful experience from beginning to end.",1

"226","predatory practices to pay more to trip.comi recently faced a highly unsatisfactory situation with trip.com that i feel compelled to share. my journey from shanghai to karachi, booked for 4007 cny, was unexpectedly disrupted when the airline decided to move the second leg of my flight from february 8th to february 13th without my consent. while a partial refund of 1845 cny was initiated, this gesture hardly made up for the inconvenience and additional costs i was subjected to.seeking to maintain my original travel schedule, i found myself facing the prospect of shelling out an extra 1013 cny due to the increased prices of alternative flights. this situation not only added financial strain but also significant stress to my travel planning.what disappoints me most is trip.coms handling of the situation. the lack of proactive communication and adequate resolution has seriously undermined my trust in their service. i expected a seamless experience, was left to navigate this disruption largely on my own.this experience has highlighted a concerning lack of customer support and flexibility in addressing issues that arise, particularly those not of the customers making. its disheartening to see such a reputed company fail to provide the necessary support and compensation to their customers in times of need.i urge potential customers to consider this review carefully before booking with trip.com. its crucial to choose a service that not only offers competitive prices but also backs it up with exceptional customer care, especially when unforeseen changes occur.",1

"457","great experiencefirst off, the prices on trip.com are really quite good and seem to beat almost everyone fairly consistently. i travel a lot and trip.com is definitely saving me some money. their rewards program seems half decent as well, on top of the other rewards you get from the airlines themselves when you book.i did have a delayed flight with a trip i booked with trip.com due to no fault of their own, but do to mechanical issues with an american airlines flight. i had booked business class but ended up in economy class on the next available flight and was refunded money. it did take a little bit to get everything sorted, but it wasnt difficult and the people at trip.com did genuinely help and the money is back in my account for the fare difference between business class and economy class. i will also say american airlines was helpful as well all along the way. i have read some reviews that say trip.com takes months to provide refunded money, but that wasnt the situation in my case at all. i also cancelled another booking i made (which was sold as a cancellable itinerary) and the money was refunded in minutes and the process was automatic from the website. i dont really see any problem with trip.com. their support is good (i was able to reach them in less than 2 minutes online) and their policies are really quite fair. the prices are better than most places. i think for people who know how to travel well, and what they want and the pitfalls that sometimes come with air travel, trip.com is a really good option. i would say if you can book directly with the airline for a similar price then go with the airline. for me, the airline sells a business class product for about $2200 and trip.com is selling it to me for $1000 and change. same flight.",5

"977","appalling serviceappalling service! we have stayed at this hotel several times pre covid. their product and service have been good when the hotel was first opened but this time, their level service has declined so much, it made our stay very frustrating and disappointing worst hotel ive ever stayed in!we were booked for a triple sharing (3 adults) room for 5 nights. noticing that there were only 2 sets of towels in the room on day 1, we asked the housekeeping staff that we met on the guest floor to add an additional set. she initially refused to add an extra set of towels saying that that is how all rooms are supposed to be set up, but eventually reluctantly gave us an extra bath towel.day 2 evening: we returned to find our room not made up (duvet was still untidy and cups unwashed) and only 2 sets of fresh towels. the phone was faulty and could not be connected to operator (by dialing 0) or any other services. when i went down to feedback, the front desk staff said that their system showed only 2 persons staying (despite taking all 3 passports for registration upon check in). she said trip.com did not communicate the triple occupancy (with extra person charges paid) to the hotel. she arranged for an extra set of toiletries to be sent up. when i asked her to ensure we do not face this same problem again for the rest of the stay, she informed that it is very likely to recur because it may be a different person cleaning our room each day so she said we will need to call them every day if we want the extra toiletries! she also explained that rooms are not cleaned everyday but we can expect it to be cleaned the next day.our room remained uncleaned the next day. for our entire 5 night stay, our room was only cleaned once. they only gave us the right number of toiletries on the last 2 days after we went down to complain again on day 3 (not only for the insufficient towels but also for not replenishing toilet roll). apart from service, the hotel room is dated and poorly maintained. the only saving grace is the housekeeping staff who delivered the extra toiletries on the 2 nights we complained. she is the only staff who sincerely apologised and offered a genuine smile. the other staff we interacted with appeared to be very rigid in their procedures and totally not guest oriented.things can go wrong but when there is no attempt in service recovery and ensuring it doesnt happen again, its a reflection of poor staff attitude be it due to lack of training or poor hiring.",1

"1078","trip.com is irresponsible for application of the refund of the full protection feebackground: i rent a car with trip.com (a travel booking website) in july 2023 and the car would be provided by avis (a rental car company) on august 11, 2023. full payment has been made already by me. the transaction was completed in july 2023. the car was scheduled for picking up at avis in amsterdam schiphol airport on aug 11, 2023. i arrived the avis counter and the staff told me that the reservation made for me by trip.com was not in their system as a prepaid booking. therefore, avis made a new contract (1853an) for me instead. some facts are:1.1 trip.com issued the rental voucher with the confirmation no (starting 1959****) in july 2023 1.2 avis issued the rental agreement indicating clearly a reference/external reservation no. (same no. as mentioned above) in august 2023 1.3 avis issued a letter and admitted that the reservation made for me by trip.com was not in their system as a prepaid booking 1.4 trip.com has charged me the full payment already and it is in fact a paid booking 1.5 trip.com has apologized the inconvenience caused to me and agreed to compensate to me some money (20% of the booking order) actually, trip.com has got my payment already. however, trip.com has made a reservation with aviss system as a not yet paid booking but not a prepaid booking.unfortunately, the car was broken down in the highway near the hotel (under 10 km) due to battery problem. eventually, i contacted the avis the other day. avis informed me that avis was unable to provide a replacement car and agreed to cancel the booking. since i have made a booking with trip.com so i had to cancel the booking accordingly. i found the payment i paid to trip.com consisting of 2 parts the car rental fee and the full protection fee. trip.com agreed to refund the car rental fee portion but refused to refund the full protection fee portion. trip.com asked me to contact the insurance company directly. it took me a lot of time to find out the insurance company (rentalcover.com) and eventually got the refund successfully. i think that it should have done by trip.com and not the customer. trip.com is irresponsible on this matter but have not yet explained it to me upon one of my requests.(updated on nov. 10, 2023)",1

"1198","scam!!! fraud!!! don't trust!!scam!!!! careful!!! don't use them!!!if i could give 0 stars i would. they stole 340 euros from me. i booked online some flight tickets that they never emitted and refused to refound.normally they would give you immediately the money back but not only they didn't.they just took my money, never emitted the tickets and wanted me to rebook another flight with my money.i spent the money i had on the first flight i bought, so how can i buy now a more expensive flight with the promise they would reimburse??? i need to reach a working destination. they cancelled the ticket without even confirming and didn't proceed yet with a reimbursement. they are not trustworthy and a real waste of time. now i'm in a situation where i'm stuck without tickets and they are holding my money because they are unable to function and provide the service they say they do.so i still need to buy a ticket to reach my working destination.it is getting more and more expensive.i'm gonna go to the authorities tomorrow to report the fraud .also if someone of the audience has some legal advice or contact to sue them it would be very much appreciated.editing my review after kylie s answer.they are the worst. they don't care and didn't give me any solution. they will hold the money of my tickets till october 12th. but i need to reach my destination by october 7th.this is a fraud. they don't give a . about the issues of the customers. it's their way or the high way.and btw the issues are totally created by them.worst company ever. unable to perform. making you loose your time. just lots of bla bla bla and they keep your money. sure i'll do my best to sue them.",1

"1859","a disheartening experience: lack of transparency & abysmal customer servicei feel compelled to share my deeply unsatisfactory encounter with trip.com. it is my sincere intention to equip fellow consumers with the necessary information to make informed decisions when engaging with this company.regrettably, my interaction with trip.com was marred by a distressing absence of transparency regarding fees and charges. their website lacked the basic courtesy of providing upfront clarity and comprehensive guidance on the intricate structures of charges and fees associated with my bookings. this glaring omission left me bewildered and frustrated, as crucial financial details were deliberately obfuscated, making it impossible to make well informed choices.adding insult to injury, the customer service i received was nothing short of abysmal. the representatives consistently displayed an alarming inability to grasp the essence of the issues i raised, preferring instead to regurgitate pre scripted responses that failed to address my concerns adequately. this robotic and disengaged approach only served to compound my dissatisfaction, as it was evident that genuine empathy and effective problem solving were mere afterthoughts in their customer service strategy.my overall experience with trip.com left an indelible impression of a business primarily driven by profiteering, with little regard for delivering the service and integrity expected of an honest enterprise. it is deeply disheartening to encounter such a flagrant disregard for ethical business practices in the travel industry, where trust and transparency should be the bedrock of every transaction.in light of these glaring deficiencies, i implore trip.com to consider the following recommendations:1. prioritise unambiguous transparency: trip.com must assume the responsibility of prominently displaying all charges and fees on their website, leaving customers with no room for confusion or ambiguity. clarity regarding the financial implications of bookings is essential to engender trust and enable customers to make well informed decisions.2. overhaul customer service: investing in comprehensive training programs for their customer service team is imperative. empathy, active listening, and personalised assistance should be the cornerstones of their approach, ensuring that customer concerns are genuinely understood and appropriately addressed.3. embrace customer feedback: establishing robust channels for customers to provide feedback and actively utilising this invaluable resource to drive continuous improvement is paramount. by openly acknowledging and addressing customer concerns, trip.com can begin to rebuild the trust they have lost and reclaim their standing in the industry.it is my fervent hope that trip.com will earnestly consider and promptly act upon these suggestions to rectify the glaring deficiencies that mar their services. as discerning consumers, we rely on companies that prioritise integrity, transparency, and a genuine commitment to service excellence.i urge fellow traveler's to exercise caution when contemplating trip.com as their preferred travel provider, as my personal experience suggests that they may not uphold the standards of transparency and service one expects from a reputable company.",1

(screenshots of airline service chat to prove this)we called trip.com again (within 6h), and this time they said they will check. turns out can reverse directions of the flight but they charged us an exorbitant amount!!!!!!our flights were booked at $233 total. to rebook our flights, they sent us an email with a countdown timer charging us a total of $1053 (almost 5x the original!!!!!!) what?!!! what if we didnt check ?!!! the timer pressuring you to payfreaking scammers!!!!!",1

"2322","their payment was refused at the hotel and i spent an hour trying to solve it.i booked a hotel at a great price and pre paid, but upon checkout, was told that the temporary card number trip.com issued for my room was rejected. the hotel could not solve this problem because trip.com has no customer service phone number it is only chat based. so the hotel was going to charge me their rate unless i could resolve this problem within an hour. their chat service is hard to find, first of all, and kept telling me i don't understand when i asked for an agent. i finally got an agent, who wrote me in broken english and asked me for 30 minutes to call the hotel and resolve things. then he wrote me back that the company they use to make payments to the hotel was closed because it was out of working hours in china. they would try again 12 hours later. that meant i was going to be charged $100 more than i'd already paid by the hotel, and i would have to try to get a refund if and when trip.com paid their part. i then spent most of my lunch with my family on my phone trying to get another agent to call the hotel and solve this right away. another 30 minutes went by and the agent said again that to fix this, she had to contact their supplier to issue a new charge number for the hotel. in the end, i think she resolved it by convincing the front desk that they would solve it and not to charge me. the point is, when i should have been enjoying the end of my vacation and being with my family, i was stuck on my phone trying to fix this. i've never had something like this happen before. so buyer beware.i think this company got lucky enough to buy trip.com but is not well run and not very trustworthy.",1

"2846","do not use this company at any costdo not use this company at any cost. i wish i had read more carefully the reviews on several websites about trip.com before booking with them. the majority of reviews detail truly awful experiences for travellers and i totally agree with them. although it was not this company's fault that united airlines cancelled one of the sectors of our round trip to new zealand, dealing with the aftermath of this has been horrendous. to date, i have had emails from five or six different individuals, often impossible to decipher because of the poor level of english as well as two personal phone calls one of which from the uk to the philippines. emails asking me to confirm any possible changes within 30 minutes of receiving them have been sent at 6. TIME AM gmt when, of course, most people are unable to reply to them at that hour of the morning and who can reply to an email within that time limit anyway? i cancelled the whole trip out of pure frustration and did receive a refund within a reasonable amount of time for the flights (around 4,150) but still have not received a refund for a vip lounge (63.00) booked for four people, despite trip.com assuring me that this has been returned. to anyone considering using trip.com, please take my advice and do not do so. it has been one of the most stressful experiences ever. trip.com agents kept repeating that united airlines were at fault because of cancelling one sector of our round trip but surely, they as an agent, should take responsibility for dealing professionally with any issues and complaints like mine. it goes against my better judgment to even award trip.com one star and i agree with many reviewers that they are not even worth this. take your business elsewhere future travellers when considering using trip.com.",1

"2861","terrible company09.01.2023terrible company, constantly washing their hands of responsibility.i called them to change a flight at TIME PM to but was told my check in status was showing as checked in and i had to call the airline themselves to have it changed before they could change my flights. i was given a very specific additional amount i'd need to pay of 344.called the airline who changed the check in status so i called trip.com again but was told their systems did not reflect the change and that i had to go back to the airline to make the changes to both my check in status and indeed the flights themselves.back i went to the airline to be told everything i had been told by trip.com was inaccurate. specifically, they could not make the change to the flight and that the check in status had definitely been updated.back to trip.com who after fobbing me off back to the airline (which i refused to do since i'd just got off the phone to them) were then able miraculously to align the check in status but the additional flight cost was no longer 344 but had changed to 411 (almost 70 more than quoted less than 4 hours earlier).nice little additional earner for someone !!!!!made my feelings known about the additional amount, deleted the app and won't be going near them again.i have also discouraged friends and family from going near them, they have no sense of doing the right thing at all. a very short sighted view trying to milk customers.the best businesses put their customers at the forefront but that seems to be the furthest thing from the minds of this companydo not use these people if you want an acceptable level of customer service, integrity or fair treatmentthe fact more than 25% of the reviews on here are 1 star tells it's own story !!!! i agreed to pay the extra 411 just to get rid of themupdate 10.1. TIME AM i have now received an email where the amount has changed again. what started as an additional 343, going up to 411 2 phone calls later, has changed again now to 744.50 !!!!!!!!!!!!!this is the contact the responder below is seemingly referring to their idea of help seems to be to ask for larger and larger payments the more you get in touch !!!!update 10.01. TIME PMthey are now trying to take the full flight cost because the email they sent in the middle of the night (without informing me to expect this email) was not actioned within the 1 hour window they give you.their argument being the flight has taken off. i asked for the change before that, it's their fault for not telling me to look out for an emailwaiting to see if their escalation team can take responsibility and reimbursement the flight cost minus cancellation feeswill provide a further update once they get back to me.what doesn't help is that everyone i have spoken to at trip.com, english is not their first language so they are perhaps not able to understand the request / issue or it's getting lost in translationa total nightmare !the responder below claims to have emailed me for the booking details.this is completely untrue, i have searched through all my emails (including spam) and there is nothing from them with the exception of the emails i have already referencedstill waiting for the contact that una below is talking aboutwould you like me to put my booking reference on here? because you certainly haven't contacted me for it.update 11.01.

(kuala lumpur being my final destination) as the situation was not working and the second flight was now before the first one i was supposed to take they offer the only option to have a correspondance of 11h waiting in the airport of manila. indeed, a new flight on the 29th. as this was the only option i was oblige to accept anyway. although they are not offering any service or compensation hotel or something for the wait, that is not the worst part they never sent me my new ticket of the 29th for the 2nd flight whether i asked they and was in discussion with them and their chatbots the three last days of my trip almost 2 times a day to make sure i would receive my ticket. they never send it to me telling me no worry you are going to receive it in 24h, 4h from now always finding new excuses and time delays. then come the day of my trip where i receive the email that my change request flight couldnt be taken into consideration and had not been accepted indeed. when you will try to contact them, they will just tell you to deal with the company and that they cannot do anything. now i will be stuck in manila i dont know for how long, i dont know when i could get a new flight so please do not make the same mistake than me. do not take this company unless you are willing to be stuck in a country, you dont know for how long and have no information on it. i normally never write reviews but as a young woman i am feeling personally extremely affected by this situation as it could also be pretty unsafe and i just prefer warn other people that might be affected like me.",1

"2934","the trip.com travel debacle: a cautionary tale of wasted timei booked a flight with trip.com 6 months in advance from melbourne to la, and after 3 days of talking to 8 different people, they forced me to refund my flight due to a scheduled flight change by the airline. i had booked this flight over 5 months ago, so when i got the call that i would miss my connection in auckland, i was hopeful that trip.com would be able to get me on another flight. however, i was extremely disappointed with the service i received.trip.com has a policy stating that if they need to do an 'involuntary rebooking' of your flight, it must be with the same airline. this proved to be a huge issue for me, as the original airline had no available flights because it is the christmas holiday. despite working with trip.com for 3 days to get on a flight with air tahiti nui, each change request took over 24 hours to hear back on. they assured me that they had marked my situation as urgent, but i never heard back before 24 hours had passed. because of this, three of my change requests were canceled.even though i had paid for this flight months ago, trip.com refused to rebook me on another flight after it was clear that the original airline had no flights available. in one instance, i spent over 3 hours on the phone with trip.com (i promise this is not an exaggeration), trying to understand why (given the circumstances) they wouldn't rebook me with a different airline. i went from willing to work with them to absolutely furious, demanding that they sort out my flight because my scheduled flight was due to leave in 12 hours. yet they wanted to put in another change request which i would have to wait another 24 hours to hear back about. no. instead, all they did was repeat their scripts, apologize, and say i'm very sorry and i know how you feel. each person i spoke with followed the same script.i will never recommend trip.com or air tahiti nui to anyone. they're unreliable and wasted hours of my life. all they will do is reply to this review with empty words and promises, saying things like we will contact you directly and address your concerns, just like they have with all the other negative reviews on this site. but the fact remains that they never made this right and offered no solution to rectify the situation. they took away the opportunity for me to see my recently widowed father and wasted hours of my life. trip.com should have rebooked me with another airline and absorbed the costs, as it was not my fault that the original airline changed my flight. you could argue that it isn't theirs either, but they had 3 days to fix this, and they didn't. they are a travel agency their business is working with their partners to sell tickets and assist in travel. isn't rebooking a flight ticket after an airline scheduled change the most basic of tasks for them? in the end, they refunded me, yet i still lost a lot of money i had spent on bookings for my trip. avoid trip.com and air tahiti nui at all costs.update: note their response below, following the same script for all the other reviews here. fun fact, they haven't contacted me.",1

"2942","forced resubscribe to torrent of marketingreasonably well organised company and great customer support.unfortunately every time you make a booking they subscribe you to all of the marketing garbage again. it's difficult to unsubscribe and they send several promotions per week. they literally go out of their way to punish you for using them. the more you use them, the more often you must unsubscribe from their torrent of marketing garbage.i travel for work. no amount of advertising or deals will make me buy a single ticket. yet i get subscribed to the entire menu, duplicated across app push notifications and email, every time i touch the app. please stop.it's a genuine pity because it's a good app and good cs team. the only thing the cs team has not been able to help me with is preventing the auto forced resubscribe.after tolerating this for a few months, booking more than 15 flights on here, and quickly becoming diamond tier, i must concede defeat and turn to another booking app. they have tried their hardest to make to leave so i shall. i have spent down my points and deleted the app.the reason i gave one start for this is that it's such a simple thing to get right and they're deliberately getting it wrong. it says a lot about how much they care about the users.edit: i'm very tired of support staff telling me i can turn off notifications in the settings page. i know. the problem is it turns back on automatically when you make any purchase. i'm not missing any sneaky i'd like to receive marketing check boxes, it just turns back on. very abusive experience. may aswell not have the setting.also should note this is not an improvement that can be worked on. forcing the notifications back on is a very deliberate choice and action on the behalf of trip.com. you could improve it in literally seconds by just not overriding the user preference.the only two honest responses are 1. yeh we know we're forcefully overriding your prefere, we know you hate it and we don't care.2. ok fair enough, you got us. we'll stop screwing with you",1

"3342","read the reviews before buyingi should have read this company's reviews before booking my flight from london to tunisia.apparently, this company gives themselves unfair advantage by booking a connecting flight that is impossible to make. then to deceive their customers and calm their fears, they clearly state in their policy that they will rectify any missed connection. if you would think, they know what they are doing, and they care about their reputation, you will be proven wrong.this kind of behaviour is wrong and should be reported to the appropriate search engines and governing bodies. this company is registered in singapore, and will probably be beyond the reach of your local authorities, so be very careful who you are buying from!in my case, they sold me a connected flight with 1 hour connection time. needless to say, this time is impossible to make and i lost my connecting flight. i had to buy a whole new ticket and stay overnight in a foreign country. moreover, and because of the missed incoming flight, i lost my return ticket, and was left stranded in tunisia without a way back. their defective itinerary had cost me and my family a lot of agony and another high price plane ticket.avoid or lodge a complaint against them. don't let them get away with it.",1
"3343","a lot of frustration while trying to rebook my flight due to covidi booked a ticket from trip.com flying to hamburg from singapore and flying back from london to singapore. due to covid my flight was canceled at the very last minute and when i approached the agent i was told i would get a full refund. so i did not claim my insurance but when the email came from trip.com it was stated to me that they will not be able to refund me but the value of my ticket will be kept in the ticket number and that if i want to rebook a trip i must book through their agent and i am not to do it from the online booking. from what i understand meaning my new booking could cost much more than what i can find online on trip.com.i tried to book a flight earlier this year in january and was told by the agent that there were no available seats for my july flight. all they have left were premium seats that cost me a lot of money.i tried again today to reach out to them, i get a standard answer from both agents that attended to me that they are bound by the rules of the airlines.that i am to book through their agents and that i cannot book online through their website. that seemed to be their excuses and i requested that if the agents were unable to assist me then refer me to a higher management who can make decision of my case.i regretted not buying the ticket directly from british airways as i would be given a voucher immediately that i can use partially or totally and the remaining left value can be used for future booking.i am highly disappointed with how trip.com handle this situation due to no fault of ours since covid has affected so many people and we had paid the full amount of $1.2k two years ago to trip.com and up till today i still cannot utilise the ticket.i would never ever book another ticket from trip.com and would discourage friends and family to do so.",1
"3344","major lack of responsibilityabsolute disgrace of a service. never ever trust trip.com. a booking was made from edinburgh to porto with a connection in mallorca with only 1 hour to the connection. now, i know my first flight was delayed by 1 hour 40 minutes so i knew i would miss my connection anyway but when i landed, i found you have to exit the palma de mallorca airport and re enter for connecting flights (this cannot and i f***ing repeat, cannot be done in 1 hour). it took 20 minutes for the landed plane to let us out, then 20 minutes to get out of the airport and then you have 2 hours waiting line to get back in (your own travel policy instructs you to be at the airport 2 hours before your flight so why did you not apply your own policy here???? there should be a 2 hour minimum before the next flight). i made this booking with full trust in trip.com believing the flight was actually from another gate inside and would not have to exit and re enter, that can be made in 1 hour yes. on trip.com they mention if there was a mistake made by ourselves we will issue a full refund what a pile of lies and customer entrapment.i phoned your agent to chase up with my old claim and to rectify this problem i've run into to make sure that no future customer will fall for the same thing but got the response of sir! we don't set the times, the airlines do! sure they do, but if i'm making a booking for you that will 100% fail leaving you stranded because the airline believes that's enough time to make it it's common knowledge that there are massive delays in airports, i would have never made the booking had i known i would have to leave and re enter the airport. this is the very same airline (ryanair) that refused to claim responsibility that there was a delay. it took me 4 days just to get them to send an email out to confirm the delay. when i called ryanair, i was also told to claim through the place where i made the booking and vice versa when i went to trip.com they drop all form of responsibility and tell me they're only following the airline's guideline. absolutely zero responsibility from trip.comi've had screenshots from ryanair app notifying the delay but that was not enough for trip.com, and unless ryanair confirms this delay, i would not get any form of compensation. it's like dealing with children.final verdict avoid at all cost, they will assure you that you will be compensated and are covered if things go south but when they actually do. they will avoid all forms of responsibility and delay your claim for as long as possible. on top of this, the insurance provided by trip.com leaves you stranded for 1 hour 30 minutes before anyone even acknowledges your existence. book straight from the airlines, this way they will have responsibility",1

"3348","trip.com site booking issue led to double charge followed by trip.com lies to keep money takenwe were looking for the round trip flight for my wife's trip to seminar in budapest for exact days (11th of august 15th of august). the suitable ryanair flights were found through the skyscanner with the reference to purchase at trip.com, which had the best rating between other agencies (later it cleared out that both skyscanner and trip.com belong to the same financial company). we chose to book, but as soon as the booking payment was made for the 11th of august and 15th of august, the final trip.com booking summary showed the departure flight dated 12 of august. we immediately used the cancel/change option on the trip.com booking, changed the date to the proper one, double verified it and chose ok . the trip.com took an additional charge. we expected to pay the fee for the change all though it looked to be the trip.com site glitch, but the charge size was suprisingly big almost equal to the one taken for the previous round trip. the wrong date flight was shown as canceled/waiting for refund , but the airfare company was still showing the flight as booked (verified directly with the airfare.company representative, who claimed the responsibility for the problem to be fully on the trip.com). to be on the safe side i contacted the trip.com by phone, explaining the situation and asking why i saw three flights instead of two and when will be the refund. the trip.com representative confirmed, that we have only 2 flights for the correct dates, that the wrong date flight is already canceled and that the refund (in proper size) will be returned in 5 business days (call recorded!).in the end it came out that no flight was canceled, every mail reminder about the officially promised refund for the trip.com site issue was answered with this is not refundable flight , please, wait for 24 48 72 hours and other non relevant responses.1. we request the trip.com to keep the officially made and recorded claim about the refund return and refund size not for the self non refundable ticket purchase and personal decision to change flight dates later but the trip.com site issue which caused that wrong date mess and the fake of change/cancel site feature which covered additional purchase and not the real change2. from personal side we definitely claim, that it was the first and the last experience with trip.com as this whole business looks to be a huge machine of collecting consumers' money by any cost without any care about own concrete technical mistakes, zero responsibility for own official claims (even recorded) and without any idea about reputation . this is not about foreign mentality , which was mentioned by complainers here we all know about the highest quality of alibaba and aliexpress customer services. this is about this concrete and specific trip.com business , which looks to stand with one leg in the illegal area of fake, deceit and theft.update:there is no option to respond to the trip.com representatives answer here so i had to update the original post.amber (if it's your real name) please, don't lie.no one contacted me or my wife directly.no one.my phone +972 54 5511020 (listed in the purchase)my wife's phone +972 50 6720944 (listed in the purchase / trip.com account we had to open).(e mails are not allowed in reviews as it cleared out but guys, you have all our e mail addresses HAPPYSMILE you can find them by our personal names in the e mails you've received during the last 2 weeks.again. no one contacted / tried to contact us as sending mails with please, wait another 72 hours (from vanessa ) or this is not re chargeble flight mail from darr is not contacting the person .we were in contact with your representative by phone, phone conversation (which was recorded), where it was told that the flight is canceled and the redung of x sum will be returned in 5 business days .all the rest we are sorry for inconvenience and we fully understand your prostration all those key words and phrases, please, leave for the newcomers trainings.please, fulfill your official claim and proceed with the re fund. your company has all the information required (including personal details), your company has all the booking and other wrong flight description details, your company has the reference to the recorded audio. stop ping ponging, start working.good luck.",1
"3349","thieving scumto call my booking experience appalling is putting it lightly. now, we already understand the difficulty of refunds and whatnot which is why we purchased the additional 50 cancellation guarantee. our flight was from chiang mai > ho chi minh city in vietnam with a connection in bangkok and we spent 262. everything was fine until they changed the first flight to make it impossible (20 minute connection time) to make the connection in bangkok, meaning that we had to alter our first flight to ensure we could get the connection. this apparently was an impossibility so we decided to use our cancellation guarantee so we can book entirely new flights. sadly, it wasn't a cancellation guarantee at all, it was a trip.com can steal all your money guarantee . the refund took over 15 days to come through and out of the 262, we recieve a measly 5.60 not even enough for a pint in some london pubs. ah but don't fret! the rest was in airline vouchers all 26 of it. this means that, out of 262 we paid, we received 31.60 in refund didn't even cover the cancellation guarantee we forked out to ensure this would not happen. trip.com and everything related is an absolute joke and i urge anyone who is planning to book through them to run as far as you can from these thieving robbing b@stards. i've never been robbed before, and don't think i want to be robbed again, hence why i will never book with trip.com. disgusted is an understatement.",1

"3371","a nightmare to get a refund. good at writing emails but terrible in giving refundslast sunday, august 7th i went to beijing t3 to board my flight from beijing to guanzhou with air china ca1351 which was due to leave at 8. TIME AM. i reached the airport at 7. TIME AM. now on my ticket, it's said that i have to be at the airport 45 minutes before departure.i am first directed to gate j with automated check in machines. i scan my passport twice and it doesn't work. so i am directed to gate k for manual check in. i join the queue and in front of me are three elderly people. they take their time and my turn arrives. as soon as i hand over my passport and the staff member says that my flight is cancelled. i say that i didn't receive any notification like that on my trip.com app and show her my ticket on my phone. she then says that the gates are closed and can't let me in, now i must mention i am a foreigner and dark skinned because this is quite important. i immediately asks for a supervisor, because there was 1. no final call is announced 2. there was no notification on the displays saying the gates were closed.the rude staff member asks me to walk across the airport to another gate to see a supervisor, to which i refuse and demands a supervisor there. then another member arrives, and she gives the same answer. i stand my ground and keep demanding a supervisor.then after a few minutes, another staff member arrives from behind at the check in counter and says she's a supervisor and asks me to follow her. she keeps me waiting behind a line and then goes and processed to watch a computer screen. i keep waiting and i just go to her asking what's going on. and she comes and tells me that i arrived at the airport at this time and came to the check in counter at this time and so on.so to save face she was watching the cctv rather than actually coming up with a solution to get me on that plane.at this time it's already 7.38. so i immediately cancel my ticket through the app and place a call to the trip.com helpline to confirm it. and what's the worst part is, the flight actually took off at 8. TIME AM. a whole 25 minutes late! while those people were wasting time i could have boarded it. i asked for a refund on sunday night, now it's friday. i have received about 8 emails from 8 different people apologizing and telling me to ask for a refund from air china! why? i bought the ticket from trip.com. i cancelled through them. i am not in the wrong. it's due to their unprofessional ground staff that i was not allowed to get on that plane while everyone else was. furthermore, i asked for a confirmation of refusal to board, and they pretended that they don't understand that.trip.com is a nightmare to deal with. i would advise people, especially ex pats in china, to avoid this app. they don't care about their clients.edittrip.com sold me the tickets, they are the ones who have the right to cancel tickets. i didn't deal with the airline company. so why is trip.com trying to wash its hands by asking me to contact air china? when i have clearly stated the whole incident with evidence. this shows how incompetent and nonchalant trip.com is about their clients.update 29th november, 2023. trip.com has not helped me in resolving this matter. truly unprofessional. their reply below is false.",1

"3373","worked fine with a few hiccups flights onlyreview is regarding flightsi was hesitant to book flights due to the mix reviews. but i went ahead since it was $300 cheaper for a rt flight to mexico from ca (i booked it only 2 months in advance). once i booked the flights, i received my confirmation number within 24 hours. because of the reviews, i was paranoid and checked my confirmation numbers on the airline website to make sure it existed every few weeks up until my trip. good thing i did that because 2 weeks before my trip, my confirmation disappeared from the airlines. i immediately contacted trip.com, they were quick and responsive and said they are working on it. i then proceed to contact my airlines to double check. they said that my tickets were paid in dubai dollars instead of usd, and that when i arrive at the airport, i would need to show them my credit card that i used or pay in cash. obviously the credit card i used was through trip.com, and trip.com used their own accounts to book it through the airlines so a bit of a pickle here. however, within 24 hours, i got my new confirmation numbers from trip.com and i verified it through my airlines and it was sorted out. i have trust issues by now so i continued to check my confirmation number on the airlines website often. it ended up working out, my trip was smooth. overall, i saved $300+ and spent maybe 2 hours at the most trying to sort things out. i believe this is a company from singapore, and not china. and i agree with the other reviews, make sure you do not need to change anything otherwise it would be an even larger headache. i normally book my flights 6+ months in advance and i would book through the actual airlines directly to avoid a third party. however, for this particular trip, i booked somewhat last minute (2 months in advance) and the costs have skyrocketed. so since it saved me a lot of money, i went ahead and booked it and it worked out with a few hiccups. just do your due diligence and check with the airlines directly to make sure everything is sorted out.",4

"3810","a great response to stress!after receiving a notification on my email requesting me to input information about my passport (expiry date), i had a bit of a panic attack since i could not recall if whether i had given those details when i booked the flights. after checking the platform, i could only see my birthdate and the id number of my passport, but couldn't access any additional information. so i decided to call and get some feedback from the trip.com call center for germany. the waiting time was surprisingly short, something which truly pleased me. the agent was incredibly friendly and prone to help me after i had explained my situation, and was very voluntary to check all the necessary information about the automatic check in. apart from solving the issue (which in fact didn't even exist, i'm generally anxious and panic easily) and informing me about everything related to the check in, i was also pleased by a fantastic conversation with the agent. this is also the reason i am writing such a positive review HAPPYSMILE ",5

"3815","trip.com mis sells ryanair flights via dublin on skyscanner.neton 28 november i bought a round trip from edinburgh to frankfurt via dublin, flying out on 2 december and back on 7 december 2021. i found the trip on skyscanner. it was sold by trip.com (booking no. 16897422120) and all flights were provided by ryanair (flights fr381 and fr383 out fr381, fr816 return). the connection time at dublin was 55 minutes. there was a warning that this is short but, at the time of booking, 55 minutes appear to me adequate to arrive at one gate and leave from an adjacent gate with the same airline. the sellers failed to take into account, and i did not know until i got there, that transit at dublin is not allowed! trip.com should know this and plan for flight connection at dublin to take at least 90 minutes.on the outgoing trip i made the connection by the skin of my teeth, even though the incoming flight was slightly early. i had to sprint the length of terminal 1, pass through customs and immigration, then turn around, come back through the security check, and sprint the full length of the terminal again. there were no delays at all, but the gate was closed when i arrived. ryanair was kind enough to let me on anyway.i did not want to risk being stranded at dublin on the way back, so i asked trip.com to rebook that journey by another route. the answer was an email saying they hoped to help me within 72 hours, which was too long, so i rebooked the trip myself on air france and easyjet via paris, giving myself 2 hours for the transit. that worked well. i should never have been offered the trip from edinburgh to frankfurt via dublin as a viable route. this is mis selling by trip.com, so i hold them responsible. i have asked for a refund, in the sum of 63.80 for the unusable return flight, comprising half of the flight costs 27.40, plus 36.40 paid to ryanair for cabin bags on the unused return leg. trip.com has so far declined to accept responsibility, saying that ryanair does not provide for cancellation. but i did not cancel willingly! i travelled that day but was obliged to take another route due to no fault on my part. the flight i booked to replace it cost about 200, so that would be suitable compensation. had i known that a reasonable route would cost 400 both ways i would not have made the trip at all! trip.com bought the four flights from ryanair under separate booking numbers (out ufuqjx, g68s7s return r9vttm, e5j5ui) so it is understandable that ryanair does not feel responsible for (or even knew about) the connection. however, ryanair could do more to make purchasers aware that connection in dublin is not possible in under 90 minutes and spot separate bookings that appear to imply a connection (same customer flying out shortly after arrival). skyscanner regards trip.com as a partner so does not take responsibility, but i think they might do more to vet partners offerings and terminate the partnership in cases of mis selling through skyscanner.remedy suggested: apology, refund, and compensation in the sum of 200.",1

"3871","visit with the kids and grandkids ruined! i was planning a trip to see my kidsi was planning a trip to see my kids at the end of july i bought my tickets july 17 2021 and paid extra for baggage for the flights. when i was looking over the tickets yesterday (sunday morning july 18 2021) i realized that they were reversed in travel. so i called within 24 hours to change the departure and arrive. they said they could contact the airlines and see if they would let them do that and also said there might be an extra amount i would have to pay i was ok with that at first cus i looked on the frontiers website on the same flight and it should have only cost me an extra $60 along with what i have already paid and i was willing to pay that. a couple of hours later they called me back and said the airline would let me do it but for an extra 150. i told them that is double what the airline would have charged me had i gone straight thru them instead of y'all and i told them to just issue me a refund. i was told i would receive the full amount for the flights and they said they could not issue a refund on baggage. i was fine with that because i was expecting a full refund for the flight. i got a message this morning and i'm only being refunded $11.00. what is wrong with companies that don't care about their consumers i did everything within a 24 period and tried to change the departure and arrive instead of getting a refund, but y'all wanted to double the price and i couldn't afford that. we as consumers go on your sites to find better deals not to be ripped off. now, i don't have the money to go see my kids thanks trip.com for ruining my visit with my kids and grandkids. sorry, i'm a consumer on a budget and had to wait to buy tickets for travel until i got paid!! next time i'll go straight thru the airlines. no more dealing with rip off companies!",1

"3878","great customer serviceafter our unfortunate experience of a delayed flight which resulted in the next connecting flight leaving us behind, i was thrilled by the prompt phone call responses and urgency attached to our situation from trip.com service providers. prior to contacting trip.com, many phone calls were made to the first air line's customer service providers that delayed our flight but all attempts were futile. in fact we were really devastated because we really wanted to reunite with our respective families after three years of not seeing each other. after taking a detailed report from us (meanwhile my junior brother who purchased the ticket was also making background calls to trip.com agents), trip.com was able to contact the next flight that left us behind and within a matter of 24 hours, our money (major part) was refunded to us. at last we had a rejuvenated hope to purchase a new ticket for the next available flight. i remember the name of lynn and according to my brother, he first contacted another wonderful and helpful guy whose name i can not recollect. i will not hesitate to contact trip.com in future on any flight related service.",5

(maybe because they saw as an honest mistake?) that was beyond nice. i went through some email exchanges and app chat. all attendants were very courteous and replies were timely. took the courage to book new flights, making extra sure of the dates. went great, finally. to put the cherry on top of the cake, i've got the refund of the wrong ones on my credit card. that was something else, my experience couldn't be more satisfying than that!",5

"3965","horrible, horrible servicei made a reservation at this hotel through trip.com and was extremely disappointed upon arrival to find two other distressed customers in the lobby. they were complaining that the computer system had double charged them, not a worry for me, i thought, because i booked online. what turned me off was the clerk, behind the register, mia, was tapping her nails on the desk, rolling her eyes at the customer, and doing nothing to assist the women ahead of me in line. in addition to her lack of professionalism and obvious disinterest in being of service to the customer, she grabbed her cell phone while the customer was asking for help and stood behind the desk texting. after waiting around while this scenario played out and observing the characters lounging around outside smoking cigarettes (not a single no smoking sign or designated smoking area to be found), i decided this hotel was absolutely not for me not for my safety as a young woman traveling alone nor do i ever, in any circumstance, support businesses monetarily whom treat their customers with such blatant disrespect. i called their reservations line and the office was willing to issue a refund until they saw i booked through a third party site. when i called trip.com to ask for a refund since i never checked in to the hotel and had booked on short notice because of a glitch in my original airbnb plans, they gave me the run around for an hour and a half, told me they needed to contact the hotel before issuing the refund. i gave my number to front desk clerk, mia, to speak with the manager and have this issue resolved so that the trip.com representatives (who, by the way, offered me $20 for emotional distress instead of a full refund) could issue my refund. the manager never called, the trip.com representatives emailed and said they could not refund me because the hotel said i checked in and stayed the full duration , which was entirely untrue. i had left the hotel and made other arrangements entirely after the original observation of the hotel's staff. at this point, i have come to believe both the hotel and trip.com have absolutely no concern for their guests whatsoever. from the original front desk clerk to the characters loitering about the motel, trip.com and the hometowne studios have demonstrated absolutely no interest in providing a safe, secure, welcoming environment for guests and potential guests. do not book this place online go see it first. the companies will, in my experience, blatantly lie about you staying in this hotel in order to avoid issuing a refund. horrible, horrible experience with both companies.",1

"4102","awful customer services, terrible processesworst travel company i've ever booked through.return flight from amsterdam to manchester with flybe was cancelled in early february due to a storm. flybe correctly advised me to arrange a refund via trip.com as the booking operator. since then i've been passed from pilar to post on various phone calls. initial calls with trip.com resulted in them incorrectly claiming the flight had departed with me on it, something they failed to understand wasn't possible as the flight was cancelled and all information evidenced this. following this they insisted i provided proof of cancellation, of which i forwarded them copies of the cancellation notices (emails and sms) from flybe. next it was a case of they couldn't use this as they still believed i was on the cancelled flight. they insisted they must wait for flybe to contact them, even though they could of contacted flybe themselves. various calls with trip.com resulted in failed promises to return calls, failures to record complaints when i had directly specified i wanted to to do, and now i'm still waiting for my refund after being told a couple of weeks ago that it had been approved. why? because apparently a refund takes 30 days. what complete and utter rubbish.never will i be booking through trip.com again, a shambles of a company with no regard for customer service. a serious review of internal customer service, complaints and refund processes are required. furthermore some of the email correspondence from trip is shocking to say the least",1

"4122","unacceptable refund handlingi am writing out of frustration of how my refund request has been handled. i have been served the runaround back and forth with this issue between ana and trip.com. i had spoken to ana and 2 other reps from trip.com yesterday about my situation with the coronavirus escalation and the subsequent level 2 designation for japan. the cdc, the us embassy in tokyo, and the state department have all advised against non essential travel to japan since this past saturday due to the continued spread of the coronavirus. per my conversations with ana and the 2 reps from trip.com last night, they assured me that i will be getting a full refund due to the unprecedented circumstances. i even repeatedly asked for reassurance from the reps and they told me not to worry as my full refund will be granted. today, i was informed that i will only be getting the taxes back due to the airline policy which is still stuck with the china only stance even though the virus situation has significantly gotten worse overnight this past weekend with new cases in japan and countries such as south korea, iran, and italy. i was provided conflicting information and now i have no choice but to accept the loss of my airfare minus the taxes even though this was not the case yesterday per my conversations with the 2 reps and ana. ana actually said that i shouldnt be calling them since the tickets were bought from trip.com and not directly through the airline which gives trip.com the authority and upper hand to decide about the refund. this has been a very stressful and disappointing experience as i was supposed to run the tokyo marathon but they canceled it due to the worsening coronavirus situation. i had used trip.com many times in the past and never had this terrible experience until now. i have been tossed around with no resolution to the issue and i had no choice but to accept the taxes only refund as opposed to the full which was promised to me yesterday. i want this email forwarded to the top executives at trip.com so they can see what ive been put through. i have many runner friends in the same situation and they were all given full refunds. even my hotel and all of my excursions in japan were very gracious in giving me full refunds as they understood the severity of the situation and that its beyond anyones control. i hope to get a quick response from trip.coms management about the mishandling of my refund request. i sure hope that trip.com will do the right thing and keep their customers happy and satisfied as business relies heavily on customer satisfaction. sent from my iphone",1

"4186","it was a good experience when i bookedit was a good experience when i booked my round trip flight ticket from taipei to san francisco. the booking process was simple to follow, and i like the fact that i can see all the ticket terms and conditions in the booking process (e.g. cancellation and change policy, baggage policy). however, i found that the change schedule process is terrible. i need to change my flying date from 1/20/2020 to 1/16/2020, so i called to the help desk and asked for help. the customer service person was polite. what i don't appreciate was that he/she cannot make the change for me right away, although they saw vacancy available at the time i called in. he/she told me that they have to send my request to another department at trip.com, and let them contact the airline to confirm if i can make the change accordingly. the whole confirmation process took around 2 hours. what's worst was that the help desk can only process one flight schedule at one time. i would like them to find available seat for me & my wife at any class at economy, and any flight on 1.16.2020. the help desk said i have to designate one flight schedule only. i was upset because seats were limited. the result was bad. around 2 hours later, the email came in and said we regret to inform you that your requested date cannot be changed since there is not economy class seats. the seat was available when i called in, but the seat was not available when i received the replied email. after several attempt (called in to the help desk a few times), i got seats for me and my wife at premium economy class, and end up paying extra rmb 5100/2 person. isn't it ridiculous. how can you keep your customer happy? making flight date changes should be hassle free. the help desk should be able to check flight availability at the time i call in. also, your help desk should be able to contact the airline and find out if the changes is available right away. i can make decision right at the call without wasting 2 hours to get confirmation (waiting 2 hours is too long. seats can be gone. just like what happen in my case). i probably would not buy airline tickets through trip.com again, until i see improvement on this issue.",2
